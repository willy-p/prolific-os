# Goals & Strategic Direction

*Last updated: January 5, 2026*

## Current Context

### What's your current role?
Technical Program Manager (M2) at Prolific Machines. Seeking promotion to Senior Manager (M3), while also seeking a new job as a product manager. I've been performing at the M3 level for the past two years, leading cross-functional strategic initiatives, building systems and processes, and serving as a de facto product manager on key projects like the Ganymede/Benchling integration.

### What's your primary professional vision? What are you building toward?
Get a job as a product manager at a climate tech or tech company. I want to leverage my unique combination of technical depth (bioprocess, AI/ML), strategic leadership experience, and system-building skills to drive meaningful product impact in the climate tech space or at innovative tech companies.



## Success Criteria

### In 12 months, what would make you think 'this was a successful year'?
I'll be fully onboarded as a product manager at a (new) climate tech or tech company, have shipped my first feature, and built strong relationships with my counterparts in product design and engineering. I'll have successfully transitioned from Program Manager to Product Manager, demonstrating that my cross-functional leadership and strategic experience translate effectively to product work.

### What's your 5-year north star? Where do you want to be?
To be a director of product at a climate-focused tech company.

## Current Focus Areas

### What are you actively working on right now?
**At work:**
1. **BMGF Project:** I'm a project manager for a project funded by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). Our goal is to deliver improved titers for MAM01 (a malaria antibody), using our optogenetic platform. Kiana is the technical lead. The final report is due on May 30, 2026.
2. **Subunit Control (SubCon) Project:** I'm a project manager for a three-part project aimed at demonstrating the value of our optogenetic platform for controlling the stoichiometric ratios of subunits of bi- and multi-specific antibodies. This involves a patent, a PoC partnership with Radiant Biotherapeutics (funded by the Gates Foundation), and a potential PoC with Lonza. 
3. **GMP Illuminator:** I'm the project manager (kind of product manager too) for a project to develop our first GMP-ready illuminator system, which will be used in a partner CDMO facility to produce the first clinical batch of therapeutic protein made using optogenetics. We need to deliver this in Q3 2027.
4. **Benchling Updates:** I'm the project manager for an initiative to capture all of our cell line development workstreams in version-controlled SOPs, and develop standardized benchling data structures and templates for use as batch records in these workflows.
5. **AI Working Group:** I started an AI working group at Prolific (Prolific AI Working Squad a.k.a. PAWS) to enable our company to use AI more effectively. We evaluate and roll out AI tools for the rest of the company as well as deliver training and knowledge on best practices.

**Outside of work:**
1. **Building an AI agent-based system for managing my job search**: Creating automated workflows for job capture, company research, application materials generation, and outreach to make my job search more efficient and effective.
2. **AI Product Management Boot Camp (Maven)**: Taking a formal PM course to complement my practical experience with structured frameworks and methodologies.
3. **Seeking promotion to M3 Senior Manager**: Working to get formal recognition for the M3-level work I've been performing for the past two years, which would strengthen my resume and demonstrate senior leadership capabilities.
4. **Building PM interview skills**: Practicing articulating my cross-functional leadership experience, strategic initiative work, and system-building in PM-specific terms.

### What are your objectives for THIS QUARTER (next 90 days)?
1. Get a promotion in my current role, from M2 Manager to M3 Senior Manager (evals likely in March).
2. Get my title changed from "Program Manager" to "Product Manager."
3. Successfully get the BMGF project on track.


### What skills do you need to develop to achieve your vision?
1. **Interviewing for product management roles**: While I have significant product management-like experience (leading strategic initiatives, serving as de facto PM on technical projects, translating vision to execution, leading AI value proposition work), I need to develop the ability to articulate this experience effectively in PM interviews and demonstrate PM-specific competencies.
2. **Product management frameworks and methodologies**: Formal PM training to complement my practical experience leading cross-functional projects and strategic initiatives.

### What key relationships or network do you need to build?
1. **Product managers at target companies**: Direct connections with PMs at climate tech and tech companies I'm interested in, who can provide insights into company culture, role expectations, and potentially refer me.
2. **Product leaders and directors**: Relationships with senior product leaders who can mentor me, provide career guidance, and potentially open doors to opportunities.
3. **Recruiters specializing in PM roles**: Recruiters who understand the PM market and can help me navigate the transition from Program Manager to Product Manager.
4. **Alumni and professional networks**: Leveraging connections from my professional background (bioprocess/manufacturing, AI/ML work) who may have moved into product roles or know PMs in climate tech.
5. **My counterparts on the projects I'm leading at Prolific:** Kiana (BMGF), Shahram (SubCon), Madeleine (GMP Illuminator)

## Strategic Context

### What's currently blocking you or slowing you down?
1. **Title mismatch**: My current title is "Program Manager" rather than "Product Manager," which creates a barrier in job applications despite having significant PM-like experience (leading strategic initiatives, de facto PM work, translating vision to execution).
2. **Need to articulate PM experience**: While I have substantial experience that translates to product management (leading cross-functional projects, building systems and processes, strategic planning, AI initiatives), I need to better articulate this in PM-specific terms for interviews and applications.

### What opportunities are you exploring or considering?
1. **Leveraging AI experience**: My work leading AI value proposition initiatives (PRADA project) and experience with AI-native platforms positions me well for PM roles at tech companies focused on AI/ML products.
2. **Cross-functional leadership experience**: My track record of leading complex, cross-functional strategic initiatives and building systems that impact multiple departments demonstrates PM-relevant skills.
3. **Climate tech alignment**: My interest in climate tech aligns with my career vision, and my technical background in bioprocess/manufacturing could be valuable for climate tech companies.
4. **Formal PM training**: Currently taking an AI product management boot camp through Maven to complement my practical experience with formal PM frameworks.

### Target Roles & Companies
**Ideal PM Roles**:
- Product Manager or Senior Product Manager at climate tech companies (renewable energy, carbon capture, sustainable manufacturing, etc.)
- Product Manager at tech companies with strong product culture and innovative products
- PM roles that leverage my technical background (AI/ML products, biotech/healthtech, manufacturing tech, data products)
- Companies with great product leadership and mentorship opportunities

**Key Criteria for Target Companies**:
- Strong product culture and leadership
- Mission-driven (especially climate/environmental impact)
- Opportunities for growth and learning
- Innovative products or technology
