# Message History & Learnings

This file tracks messages you've sent and patterns in your communication style. Claude will reference this to better match your preferences over time.

---

## How This Works

Each time you use the slack-messages skill and share what you actually sent, an entry will be added here. Over time, this builds a picture of your communication style:

- **Tone preferences** - How formal/casual you tend to be
- **Length patterns** - Whether you prefer brevity or detail
- **Common phrases** - Words and structures you gravitate toward
- **Situation handling** - How you approach different types of messages

## Your Message History

### Example 1 – Requesting Status Update

**Context:** Asking Sara for an update on Radiant master agreement status

**What you sent:**
> Hi @Sara! Quick question about our status with Radiant: Have we finalized the master agreement, or are there still additional steps we need to complete on our end? Just want to make sure we're aligned on next steps. Thanks!

**Observations:**
- Opens with friendly "Hi @[Name]!" format with exclamation point
- Uses "Quick question about..." framing to signal low burden
- Asks a specific either/or question (finalized vs. additional steps)
- Includes collaborative language: "on our end", "we're aligned"
- Adds context for why asking: "Just want to make sure..."
- Closes with simple "Thanks!"
- Medium length – not too brief, not overly detailed
- Professional but warm tone

---

### Example 2 – Meeting Follow-Up with External Partner

**Context:** Follow-up after a productive meeting with Arif (external partner at Radiant) about project scope changes. Summarizing decisions for the internal team and assigning next steps.

**What you sent:**
> Hey all, thanks for making time to meet with Arif today – that was very productive and I think we're all aligned!
>
> :handshake::skin-tone-2: Key decisions:
> Arif accepted our proposal to:
> use single-vector designs for the monospecific HIV Multabody (pools 5 &6),
> and to replace one of the pools for that molecule with a CMV design to have a direct comparison between CMV and Opto to demonstrate titer improvements for Multabodies
> We will also use the same approach for the RSV Multabody.
> Arif proposed this so that we can compare more directly between RSV and HIV MB expression.
> Radiant has noted potential cloning challenges for the single-vector Multabody designs. If Prolific encounters cloning constraints for these single-vector constructs, Prolific will produce a single two-vector pool for each of the impacted construct(s) while preserving the intended Opto vs. CMV comparison.
> cc: @Victor for visibility
>
> :black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar: Next steps:
> I've updated the SOW here (Rev 004) to reflect the agreed-upon changes.
> @Vidar @Shahram please review the Scope of work section as that's all that has changed. I updated the pools as well as the description to make it more clear what we're trying to do with each one.
> @Vidar – Arif left a comment in the Other notes section re: future work. Can you please answer in a comment or change the language if needed?
> Please review by EOD Tomorrow
> We'll be presenting our high-level Technical Plan on Thursday at the Bio Strategy meeting
> Team meeting tomorrow at 4pm. Please add any topics you'd like to address to our notes doc. Thanks!
> Thanks!

**Observations:**
- Opens with gratitude and positive framing: "thanks for making time" + "very productive" + "all aligned"
- Uses emoji as section headers (:handshake: Key decisions, :black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar: Next steps)
- Structures complex info clearly: decisions first, then next steps
- Attributes decisions properly: "Arif accepted our proposal", "Arif proposed this"
- Includes rationale: "so that we can compare more directly"
- Acknowledges contingencies: "If Prolific encounters cloning constraints..."
- Uses @mentions for specific action items with clear owners
- Includes cc for visibility without requiring action
- Specifies deadline: "EOD Tomorrow"
- Provides context on why review matters: "that's all that has changed"
- Links related events: Thursday presentation, team meeting
- Ends with collaborative ask: "Please add any topics... Thanks!"
- Double "Thanks!" (closer + sign-off) – warm but may be redundant

---

### Example 3 – Meeting Notes with Action Items

**Context:** Quick follow-up after an internal team meeting, sharing notes and action items.

**What you sent:**
> Thanks for the productive meeting this morning, everyone!
> Notes are here, action items below:
> @Will to send Opto questions document today [link]
> @Mads leading MVP URS meeting tomorrow
> @Max Hu compiling visual materials for Phil Sanders meeting on Friday
> @Max Hu coordinating Lonza visit (February)
> Brandon confirmed hosting availability
> @Will @Mads to determine who will own requirements (and requirements management tool)
> @Will to check-in on hardware concepts in mid-Jan re: sharing w/ BPD, opto
> @Will to check in with George re: bio roadmap in Jan

**Observations:**
- Very brief opener: "Thanks for the productive meeting this morning, everyone!"
- Immediately points to notes doc with "Notes are here"
- Action items as simple list – no bullets, no emoji headers
- Each action item follows pattern: @Owner + task + timeframe
- Includes self-assigned items (transparency, accountability)
- Mix of specific dates ("today", "tomorrow", "Friday") and looser timeframes ("mid-Jan", "February")
- No closing – ends with last action item
- Minimal formatting – scannable without being over-structured
- Includes context in parentheses where helpful: "(and requirements management tool)"

### Example 4 – Project Update with Multi-Topic Summary

**Context:** Update to the GMP Illuminator project channel after two related meetings (a presentation and a steering committee meeting). Sharing notes, key discussions, and action items across multiple workstreams.

**What you sent:**
> @Alex Toda gave a great presentation this afternoon to Mads, Max Hu, Ryan and me to explain control architecture for bioprocess systems. The notes from our meeting are here; feel free to reach out to me or Alex if you have any questions!
>
> We also had our monthly GMP Illuminator Steering Committee meeting this afternoon. Here are the notes from our meeting.
> Key Discussion: Need for resources from biology team (likely Opto) to support scale-up experiments for GMP Illuminator.
> Requires drafting questions -> scoping experiments -> estimating work.
> Next steps: Taylor is drafting a list of questions that need to be answered to determine optical specs for the illuminator, to be shared with Opto team for feedback. We'll collaborate on estimating work required.
> @Max Hörner to send a list of what characterization is being done currently on Opto cell lines to understand what the delta is between what's being done and what Taylor needs
> Re: Biology resourcing meeting this week – we will provisionally assign 0.5–1 FTE to scale up work in 2026 but we'll check in on a monthly basis. This group is aligned that the work needs to be resourced throughout 2026 to meet our timeline of a first clinical batch in Q3 2027.
> Action Items:
> Opto questions & resourcing for GMP Illuminator:
> @Max Hu: Provide input on prioritization for Taylor's opto question list to help scope biology resourcing requirements
> @Vidar: Own roadmap development for cell lines that could be used for first GMP batch (Green Apple, Raspberry mAbs)
> @Will: Schedule workshop later this week or next to combine Taylor's experimental questions with business priority input for resourcing decisions
> Ambient light sensitivity:
> @Vidar Validate whether cells need protection from ambient light (from customer perspective) for first product and establish timeline for this decision
> @Victor: Assess feasibility of developing methods to culture cells under ambient light in seed train, including evaluation of chemical repressor needs and light-sensitivity experiments
> Scale-up working group:
> @Alex Toda Establish scale-up working group to own coordination between product, cell line development, process development, and hardware teams (@Will to help kick off)

**Observations:**
- Opens by highlighting a teammate's contribution: "@Alex Toda gave a great presentation"
- Invites follow-up: "feel free to reach out to me or Alex if you have any questions!"
- Links to notes docs for both meetings
- Uses "Key Discussion:" to highlight the main topic
- Shows process flow: "drafting questions -> scoping experiments -> estimating work"
- Provides business context: timeline ("Q3 2027"), resourcing ("0.5–1 FTE"), alignment ("This group is aligned")
- Action items grouped by workstream/topic (Opto questions, Ambient light, Scale-up)
- Each action item: @Owner + specific task (what to do + why it matters)
- Includes self in action items with supporting role noted: "(@Will to help kick off)"
- No emoji headers – relies on text labels ("Key Discussion:", "Next steps:", "Action Items:")
- Longer format appropriate for steering committee update to broader audience

### Example 5 – Giving Constructive Feedback to a Colleague

**Context:** Addressing a pattern of missed deadlines and lack of communication with Vidar on GMP Illuminator requirements. Balancing direct feedback with relationship preservation.

**What you sent:**
> Hey Vidar – about the GMP Illuminator requirements, I know things are hectic, but I'd appreciate a bit more proactive communication on whether I can count on you to contribute. Your input on the commercial requirements is really important to make sure we're capturing the right priorities and tradeoffs for customers.
> It's totally fine if you can't meet an initial deadline, but when something slips without a heads-up, it puts me in a tough spot with planning and sends the wrong message to the team. I want to make sure we stay aligned and keep momentum.
> If you can't get them done by end of day tomorrow, just let me know before you head out for the weekend. I appreciate your help on this project and am glad you're involved – your perspective has been super helpful!

**Observations:**
- Opens casually but gets to point quickly: "Hey Vidar – about the GMP Illuminator requirements"
- Acknowledges their situation first: "I know things are hectic"
- Uses "I" statements for the ask: "I'd appreciate a bit more proactive communication"
- Explains why their contribution matters: "really important to make sure we're capturing the right priorities"
- Separates behavior from person: "It's totally fine if you can't meet an initial deadline"
- Names the specific impact without blame: "puts me in a tough spot with planning and sends the wrong message to the team"
- Frames positively around shared goals: "stay aligned and keep momentum"
- Gives a specific, actionable ask: "just let me know before you head out for the weekend"
- Closes with genuine appreciation and value: "your perspective has been super helpful!"
- Three-paragraph structure: context + impact → specific ask → appreciation
- Tone is direct but not accusatory – assumes good intent throughout

### Example 6 – Cross-Functional Request with Sensitive Dynamics

**Context:** Asking Zack (scientist on Opto team) to share experiment details to inform GMP Illuminator specs. History of follow-through challenges with Zack, but need to set up reliable collaboration without being confrontational. DM includes Max (Zack's manager), Madeline (hardware), and Taylor (optical engineer).

**Your prompt to AI:**
> Act like an expert product manager and communication coach who specializes in cross-functional collaboration between R&D, optics, and hardware teams.
>
> Objective: Help me rewrite a short Slack DM so I can improve collaboration between my project (the GMP Illuminator) and the Opto team, while clearly and respectfully asking for concrete next steps from Zack.
>
> Context:
> - Audience: Max (head of the Opto team) and Zack (scientist on the Opto team). The DM will also include Madeline (hardware architect) and Taylor (optical engineer) who is drafting a list of questions for Opto.
> - Dynamic: I've previously had challenges with Zack following through on work in his role. I want this message to set us up for reliable collaboration without sounding accusatory or confrontational.
> - Purpose: We're aligning on experiments and information needed to set specifications and design for the GMP Illuminator, and want to leverage experiments the Opto team is already running.
>
> [Draft and task instructions...]

**What you sent:**
> Hey @Max Hörner @Zack H – we're pulling together a list of questions we need to answer to set specs and design for the GMP illuminator, and we'd love to anchor that in what the Opto team is already doing.
>
> Max mentioned you're likely already running many of the key experiments (dark reversion, opto system kinetics, sensitivity curves, multiplexing, etc).
>
> @Zack H, could you draft a short list of the main experiment types you're running for the opto chassis (1–2 lines each on goal, conditions, readouts, and expected timelines)? That will help us see where we can reuse data vs where we truly need new work.
>
> If possible, having a first pass early next week would be ideal.

**Observations:**
- Opens with shared context: "we're pulling together a list of questions"
- Frames request around their existing work: "anchor that in what the Opto team is already doing"
- References manager's input to add weight: "Max mentioned..."
- Gives concrete examples of what you're looking for: "(dark reversion, opto system kinetics, sensitivity curves, multiplexing, etc)"
- Specific ask with clear format: "1–2 lines each on goal, conditions, readouts, and expected timelines"
- Explains why it matters: "help us see where we can reuse data vs where we truly need new work"
- Soft but clear timeline: "If possible, having a first pass early next week would be ideal"
- No emoji, no closing "Thanks!" – clean and direct
- Includes manager in the DM for accountability without calling it out
- Under 100 words – concise for the complexity
- Avoids any reference to past issues – focuses entirely on moving forward

**Prompting patterns noted:**
- Specifies role/expertise for the AI
- Provides full context: audience, dynamics, purpose
- Names the sensitive dynamic explicitly so AI can navigate it
- Gives concrete constraints: word count, no emojis, specific format
- Asks for one final version only

### Example 7 – Onboarding a Difficult Stakeholder to a Project

**Context:** Inviting Zack (difficult scientist to work with) to join the GMP Illuminator specifications project. Need to establish his role clearly while giving him autonomy over his level of involvement.

**What you sent:**
> Hey Zack, we've kicked off a project to define specifications for the GMP Illuminator, which will be used to produce our first batch of clinical material for a customer.
> I gave Max a quick overview yesterday, and he suggested you'd be the best person on the opto team to own the optogenetic-related specifications, given your work characterizing our opto systems and your input on the design of our other illuminator platforms.
> We'll be meeting every other Wednesday at 11 a.m., starting Nov 5. I'd love to include you in those meetings, but I know not everything we cover will be directly relevant. I can invite you as optional and flag the sessions where your input is most needed, or you're welcome to join regularly if you'd like.
> Here's the project charter [link] and the draft requirements list [link] we've compiled so far. Happy to chat through the project in person too if that's helpful.
> Let me know if you'd like to meet to go over the project in more detail and what setup works best for your involvement in the team meetings.

**Observations:**
- Opens with project context and business importance: "first batch of clinical material for a customer"
- Uses manager endorsement to establish legitimacy: "Max suggested you'd be the best person"
- Explains why they're the right fit with specific examples: "your work characterizing our opto systems and your input on the design of our other illuminator platforms"
- Gives concrete meeting details: "every other Wednesday at 11 a.m., starting Nov 5"
- Offers flexibility on involvement level: "optional and flag the sessions" vs "join regularly if you'd like"
- Acknowledges their time: "I know not everything we cover will be directly relevant"
- Provides resources upfront: project charter + draft requirements list
- Multiple pathways to engage: links, in-person chat, or a meeting
- Closes with open question that gives them control: "what setup works best for your involvement"
- No pressure, no past baggage – positions as an opportunity
- Respectful of their expertise and autonomy throughout

### Example 8 – Status Request to Multiple Recipients with Personalized Note

**Context:** Checking in with Basanta and John R on cell lines they were maintaining over the holidays for the BMGF project. John is currently sick. Kiana included for visibility since she's on the project.

**What you sent:**
> Hey @John Resngit @Basanta, happy new year! Thanks both for coming in over the holidays to keep our cells happy – you guys rock! :bow::skin-tone-2:
> Wanted to check in on the status of those cells – would you mind sharing a brief update on anything that happened over the break and where things currently stand? Thanks!
> (and @John Resngit, sorry to hear that you're sick – no need to respond to this today. Feel better :mending_heart:)

**Observations:**
- Opens with multiple @mentions together when message is for both people equally
- "Happy new year!" – seasonal warmth appropriate for first post-holiday contact
- Genuine gratitude for holiday work: "Thanks both for coming in over the holidays"
- Casual, warm language: "keep our cells happy", "you guys rock!"
- Uses emoji for warmth in gratitude (:bow::skin-tone-2:)
- Status ask is open-ended but bounded: "brief update on anything that happened over the break and where things currently stand"
- Personalized aside to one recipient in parentheses – acknowledges individual circumstance without making it the focus
- Explicitly removes pressure from sick colleague: "no need to respond to this today"
- Empathetic emoji for personal note (:mending_heart:)
- "Thanks!" closer after the ask
- Kiana included in DM for visibility (mentioned in context, not in message itself)
- Pattern: when looping someone in who doesn't need to act, no need to call it out if it's clear from context

### Example 9 – Channel Update: Project Decision with Ongoing Work

**Context:** Announcing a decision to pause work on 156 CMV clones to the #bmgf channel. Kiana asked Will to communicate this to the broader team.

**What you sent:**
> Hey team, quick update on the 156 CMV clones:
> Decision: We're pausing the BPD handoff so we can prioritize scaling up lines that more closely match our expected opto clone composition. The 156 clones are frozen down and available if we need them later.
> Still in progress: The 24DWP production data is still valuable, so AnChem is running HPLC (this week) and SEC (next week) – no intact mass for now.
> Please post any questions in the thread! :thread:

**Observations:**
- "Hey team" opener for channel messages (vs "Hey all" for smaller groups)
- Bold labels for structure: "Decision:" and "Still in progress:" – scannable without emoji headers
- Explains the "why" briefly: "so we can prioritize scaling up lines that more closely match our expected opto clone composition"
- Acknowledges optionality: "frozen down and available if we need them later"
- Uses team/function attribution ("AnChem") instead of individual @mention for channel updates – more appropriate for broadcast
- Parenthetical timelines: "(this week)" and "(next week)" – easy to scan
- "Please post any questions in the thread! :thread:" – good channel hygiene, keeps discussion contained
- No "thanks" closer – not needed for decision announcements
- Concise: gets the key info across without over-explaining

**Pattern noted:** For channel decision announcements, team attribution works better than individual callouts. Save personal thanks for DMs or threads.

### Example 10 – Group Channel Announcement: Goal-Setting & Meeting Update

**Context:** Announcing a Q2 goal to the PAWS (Prolific AI Working Group) team, moving the meeting date, and soliciting input on how to achieve the goal. Message to a working group channel.

**What you sent:**
> :feet: Hey PAWS team! :feet:
> :calendar: Quick scheduling note first: our next meeting is moving to next Thursday at 2pm.
> :boom: Now the bigger thing I want to share – I've been thinking about what success looks like for this group, and I want to propose a goal: `**By end of Q2, 100% of Prolific employees say AI improves their productivity, with 80% saying PAWS helped them get there.**`
> That's a high bar. Right now, we're doing great work sharing tips and evaluating tools – but to hit these numbers, we'll need to think bigger: more structured training, clearer playbooks, maybe some team-specific rollouts of new tools. Before our next meeting, I'd love to hear your thoughts: `*What do you think would actually help the company level up on AI?*` Drop ideas in the thread – even rough ones are helpful.
> :arrows_counterclockwise: Also, please review the notes from last time and follow up on any action items you own. The framing I shared last meeting still holds: *what can you do in 15 minutes or less this week to help someone else use AI better?* Looking forward to it.

**Observations:**
- Emoji section headers for scannability (:feet:, :calendar:, :boom:, :arrows_counterclockwise:) – consistent with style for group channel messages
- Leads with logistics briefly, then pivots to strategic content: "Now the bigger thing I want to share"
- Uses code formatting (backticks) around the goal to make it visually unmissable
- Bold within code block for extra emphasis on the key statement
- Seeds the conversation with specific ideas: "more structured training, clearer playbooks, maybe some team-specific rollouts"
- Specific, answerable question: "What do you think would actually help the company level up on AI?"
- Thread prompt: "Drop ideas in the thread – even rough ones are helpful" – lowers barrier to participation
- Callback to previous framing: "The framing I shared last meeting still holds" – creates continuity
- Italics for the repeated framing question to distinguish from new content
- "Looking forward to it" as warm but brief close
- Structure: scheduling → goal announcement → context/why it's hard → ask for input → action items

**Pattern noted:** For strategic/goal-setting announcements, lead with the goal (not logistics), seed the conversation with ideas so people have something to react to, and use formatting (code blocks, bold, italics) to create visual hierarchy. Emoji headers work well for group channels where scannability matters.

- Either/or questions to get specific answers
- Emoji as section headers for longer messages (:handshake:, :black_right_pointing_double_triangle_with_vertical_bar:)
- "cc: @[Name] for visibility" – includes stakeholders without assigning action

### Structure patterns
- For complex updates: positive opener → key decisions → next steps
- @mentions with specific action items and clear owners
- Deadlines stated clearly: "EOD Tomorrow", "by [date]"
- Context for why action matters: "that's all that has changed"
- Links related events to create cohesion

### By situation type
- **Status requests:** Collaborative framing ("our end", "we're aligned"), specific questions, context for why asking
- **Status requests (multiple recipients):** Multiple @mentions up front, acknowledge shared contribution, personalized asides in parentheses for individual circumstances, explicitly remove pressure when appropriate
- **Meeting follow-ups (external partner):** Gratitude opener, emoji section headers, decisions with attribution, next steps with owners and deadlines, cc for visibility
- **Meeting notes (internal):** Brief gratitude opener, link to notes, simple action item list (@Owner + task + timeframe), no closing needed, minimal formatting
- **Project/steering committee updates:** Highlight teammate contributions, link to notes, "Key Discussion:" label, action items grouped by workstream, business context (timelines, FTE, alignment), text labels instead of emoji for formal updates
- **Constructive feedback:** Acknowledge their situation first, use "I" statements, explain why their contribution matters, separate behavior from person, name impact without blame, frame around shared goals, give specific actionable ask, close with genuine appreciation
- **Cross-functional requests (sensitive dynamics):** Frame around their existing work, reference manager input for weight, give concrete examples and specific format for deliverable, explain why it matters, soft but clear timeline, include manager for accountability without calling it out, avoid past issues – focus forward
- **Onboarding difficult stakeholders:** Lead with business importance, use manager endorsement for legitimacy, explain why they're the right fit with specifics, give concrete details (meeting times), offer flexibility on involvement level, provide resources upfront, multiple pathways to engage, close with open question giving them control
- **Channel decision announcements:** "Hey team" opener, bold text labels for structure (Decision: / Still in progress:), brief "why" explanation, use team/function attribution instead of individual @mentions, parenthetical timelines for scannability, invite thread questions for channel hygiene, no "thanks" closer needed
- **Group channel announcements (goal-setting/strategic):** Emoji section headers for scannability (:feet:, :calendar:, :boom:, :arrows_counterclockwise:), lead with strategy/goal before logistics, use code formatting (backticks) for emphasis on key statements and questions, bold for emphasis within code blocks, seed conversation with specific options/ideas, one clear ask with thread prompt, callback to previous framing for continuity
