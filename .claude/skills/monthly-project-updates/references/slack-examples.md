# Slack Message Examples for Project Updates

Post to #project-updates channel after creating the monthly update markdown.

## Format

```
:star:<emoji><Project Name> Update<emoji>:star:
<Brief team shoutout - 1-2 sentences, warm and appreciative>
Recent highlights include:
<emoji><Highlight 1 - quantitative win with context>
<emoji><Highlight 2 - quantitative win with context>
<emoji><Highlight 3 - quantitative win with context>
Required reviewers @Name1 @Name2
```

## Example: SubCon (Multi-Workstream with Subprojects)

Use this structure when a project has multiple sub-projects with different statuses and a key decision to highlight.

```
:dna: :microscope: SubCon Monthly Update :microscope: :dna:
:robot_face: Welcome to SubCon! Also known as Project Subunit Control :robot_face:
:hatching_chick: We have three SubCon sub-projects in flight :hatched_chick:

- Ratiometric Control Patent (Epcoritamab) -- Pools are in recovery; first pool production run data expected ~Feb 21
- Radiant aka Cinnamon (HIV & RSV Multabodies) -- Start was delayed 1 month due to Master Agreement negotiations but we've received their sequences! Vector development is underway.
- Raspberry (3-chain bispecific)-- On hold; earliest start April 1, pending POC 1 results

:white_check_mark: Decision: We added a single-vector design for one trispecific Multabody this week to improve our chances of boosting titer for Radiant's highest-priority molecule.
:pray: Thank you @Shahram @Noreen @Amritha Menon @Ian for moving this forward! And special shoutout to @Sara for getting the agreement with Radiant across the line! :checkered_flag:

**Slides:** [SubCon Monthly Update (Jan 2026)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r1SJ0kKQVC3BBRE1iiKcLKwlSpEYXsLf4mmfPqSQfFQ/edit?slide=id.g3b84aef65f2_2_335#slide=id.g3b84aef65f2_2_335)

## Example: Green Apple (Celebratory)

```
:star::green_apple:Green Apple Update:green_apple::star:
The small but mighty Green Apple team has been doing an incredible job over the past month! There is continued enthusiasm from our champion at the company as well! Thank you to the entire team (screenshot below) :smile:
Recent highlights include:
:fire:All-in-one clone screen run highlights clones reaching >0.4g/L (unpurified, proA BLI) - customers best-ever fed-batch performance reached 0.4g/L (proA HPLC on crude sample)
:sparkles:Effective BLI titers following ProA purification show up to 2x improvement with opto over CMV
:trophy: SEC following ProA purification highlights more monomer (up to 98%), less HMWS from opto vs CMV clones
Required reviewers @Vidar @Max Hörner
```

## Example: BMGF (At Risk + Highlights)

Use this structure when a project has significant risks but also wins to celebrate.

```
:earth_asia: :antibody: BMGF Project Update :antibody: :earth_africa:
:warning: Project At Risk Due to Cell Line Development Issues: :warning:
There has been a ~3-month delay in generation of a light-inducible MAM01 cell line.
:exclamation:Impacts of delay:exclamation:
Severely compressed timelines for process development → increased risk of lower overall titers and product not meeting PQ requirements.
Significantly shorter timeline for Aims 2 and 3 → less room for troubleshooting.
:arrow_right: Several parallel mitigation strategies are being pursued. These are outlined in the slides and will be discussed in Bio Strategy this week.
:sparkles: Highlights :sparkles:
:chart_with_upwards_trend: CMV MAM01 minipools achieved highest titer yet (6.6 g/L) with extremely high productivity (Qp of 110 pg/cell-d)
:handshake: Puro/GS double selection + MSX supplementation significantly improved productivity and overall titers for CMV MAM01 (while producing ~90% monomers)
:pray: Thank you to the team @John Resngit @Sasha @Brenna @Basanta @Ian @Evelyn Hernandez @Brandon @James @Nessa for your resilience and hard work despite many speed bumps. We've got this! :rocket:
Required reviewers: @Deniz @Victor @Alex Toda

## Guidelines

- **Emoji choice**: Pick emoji that match the project theme or branding
- **Tone**: Match the project status:
  - **On track**: Celebratory, acknowledge team wins
  - **At risk**: Lead with risk/impact, then pivot to highlights and team appreciation
- **Highlights**: Focus on quantitative wins (g/L, %, improvement factors)
- **At-risk projects**: State the risk clearly, explain impacts, note mitigation path, then celebrate wins anyway
- **Team shoutout**: Always thank the team - especially important when things are hard
- **Brevity**: 3-4 highlights max; link to full update if needed
- **Reviewers**: Tag at the end so they get notified
