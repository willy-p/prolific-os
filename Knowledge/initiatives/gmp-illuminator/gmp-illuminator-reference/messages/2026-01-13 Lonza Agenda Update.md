# Lonza Agenda Update
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Source:** Slack message from Max Huisman relaying Brandon (Lonza)
**Visit:** Lonza facility, Bend OR — 2026-02-05

## Notes
- Lonza suggests dinner Thursday evening.
- Agenda topics approved with scope limits for R&D-only attendees:
  - CLD process walkthrough will be high-level; equipment comments OK; detailed operational specs are later-stage and not in scope.
  - Process validation discussion will be general; R&D develops platform data used to set operating ranges, while GMP validation is done independently for commercial operations.
  - Illuminator-relevant equipment: yes.
  - Specific design considerations: yes, but GMP equipment evaluation/validation is out of scope for the R&D team.
  - Installation and user requirements: can cover R&D intake, process development, and platform transfer to operations; GMP specifics not covered.
  - Ongoing relationship: yes, right people present.
- Lonza does not see any fundamental unvalidatable issues with current designs.
- Lonza will send a high-level agenda and timing if this scope sounds good.

## Action Items
- [ ] Confirm dinner plan for Thursday evening.
- [ ] Acknowledge scope limits and request the high-level agenda/timing.
- [ ] Prepare questions focused on R&D-level process, equipment, and platform transfer.
