> We’re developing a next-generation illumination platform designed to bring precise, programmable light control to large-scale bioproduction. Our next generation of  illuminators will be modular, industry-ready system that integrates seamlessly with common single-use bioreactors (SUBs) and enables advanced biological processes that rely on light as a control signal. While the underlying biology can be complex, the mission is simple: deliver a robust, scalable lighting solution that helps customers run more flexible, efficient, and high-performance production processes. We’re now seeking early expert input as we shape the system architecture, requirements, and development plan for GMP-readiness of our illuminator technology.
