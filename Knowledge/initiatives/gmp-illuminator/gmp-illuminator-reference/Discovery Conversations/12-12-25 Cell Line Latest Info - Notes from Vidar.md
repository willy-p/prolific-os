Notes from our discussion on cell lines & light shielding requirements for manufacturing - adding Kiana, Max Hu, Mon and Emily for info
*   Green apple and Raspberry cell lines are the most likely to reach customer (GMP) manufacturing first
*   Gavpo is less sensitive compared to Cry2, reducing potential impacts from variations in light exposure
*   Light exposure variation would likely induce process variation that could be problematic - we likely need interventions (at least local green light or shielding)during the seed train
*   Blimp 1 would make it very difficult to implement OG - it is highly preferable that our first cell lines do not include a growth inhibiting function
*   Chemical suppression should be an absolute last resort
*   Key concerns:
    *   GMP banking - should happen under safe light to make sure cells are in their most healthy state
    *   Vial thaw - likely needs to be under safe light
    *   Seed train - exposure will need to be managed - interventions will be required and clear SOPs to ensure proper handling (perhaps we need a sensor that highlights light exposure?)
    *   Production reactor - shielding might be necessary based on the need for precise control
*   Actions:
    *   Vidar to share notes (done)
    *   Max, Victor: Schedule biostrategy discussion to review current plans with a focus on scaling
        *   Based on that regroup and define strategy
