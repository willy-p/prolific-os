Hello team! Here’s a summary with **key recommendations from my conversation with** [**James Cunningham**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-cunningham-508b8480/) ([Mytos](https://www.mytos.bio/)) this morning.
**Topic:** Lessons from Mytos’s path to GMP-ready hardware and scaling customer-facing systems
**1\\. Control & Reliability**
*   Design hardware for **consistent, repeatable installs** and minimal user error.
*   Expect wide variation in user competence — make systems robust to misuse.
*   **Test aggressively in-house** and deploy early units in real environments to uncover unpredictable failure modes.
*   Instrument for sensing and failure tracking; learn fast before scale-up.
**2\\. Parallel GMP & Learning**
*   **Don’t wait for GMP** to start learning from customers.
*   Push early, research-use units into customer hands to gather feedback before compliance slows iteration.
*   Once under GMP, every change requires validation — learn while you can still move fast.
**3\\. Focus & Prioritization**
*   **Hyperfocus resources** on the few systems critical for customer delivery and proof at scale (e.g., GMP bag illuminator).
*   De-prioritize internal-only devices and nonessential development work.
*   Concentration enables faster iteration, clearer ownership, and team alignment.
**4\\. Team & Structure**
*   Build a balance between **development** and **operations**:
    *   Engineers focus on design and improvement.
    *   Technicians handle assembly, installs, and first-line troubleshooting.
*   Add targeted senior hires (e.g., **staff mechanical engineer**, **lightweight quality/compliance support**, later **software dev**).
*   Keep production in-house until volumes justify outsourcing — gives control and flexibility.
**5\\. GMP & Regulatory Strategy**
*   Start with a **User Requirement Specification (URS)** co-written with a first customer — this defines your compliance scope.
*   Focus on three pillars:
    1. **Company posture** (e.g., ISO 9001 if valuable, not mandatory)
    2. **Device safety** (start from IEC 61010 or UL/CE equivalents)
    3. **Customer requirements** (GMP expectations from CDMOs)
*   **Stay pragmatic:** avoid over-engineering quality systems or hiring large compliance firms early on.
**6\\. Culture**
*   Keep a **high-trust, energetic team** — hire people who energize you.
*   Expect a “figure-it-out” mindset: “We need to be GMP in 9 months? Okay, we’ll get there.”
*   Strong, motivated teams beat process-heavy organizations at this stage.
**Core takeaway:**
> Build reliability and learning loops now, stay focused on the few systems that matter, and grow the team and processes just far enough to support GMP readiness — not beyond what’s needed.
