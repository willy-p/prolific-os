## 1\\. Key Decisions & Previous Action Items
#### Decisions

#### Previous Action Items
- [x] **All:** Add any outstanding questions to the [Master Questions List](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/dc/12h8j1-49171/12h8j1-114771) in ClickUp. We’ll use this as a central repository and review it on a monthly basis.
- [ ]     **Initial design feedback:**
    - [ ] [@Taylor Hinsdale](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U06MD5ZU6FL) schedule a meeting with the BPD and Opto teams to share learnings from the initial Hardware design session and collect feedback from them.→**Schedule for end of Jan when design concepts are more complete**
- [x] [@Mads](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02Q6LGN490) circulate the [Videos of large SUB bag installation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTTo7bYVT6_6NK1aDZBi6LC4gyP64rf_uznRgAKaH5E/edit?usp=sharing) that Pete shared with the HW team
- [ ]     **Requirements management:**
    - [ ] [@Taylor Hinsdale](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U06MD5ZU6FL) [@Mads](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02Q6LGN490) [@pete czerpak](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U06G77LEB52) please reach out to any system engineers in your network (<15 min) to ask their opinion whether we need a requirements management system at this stage / what their opinions are
    - [ ]     [@Taylor Hinsdale](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U06MD5ZU6FL) draft a doc listing the requirements management softwares on the market w/ pricing (if available) and user feedback
        - [ ] taylor will share a spreadsheet.
        - [ ] **Action - determine who will own requirements (they should take a class)**
- [ ]     **URS / FRS:**
    - [x]     [@Mads](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02Q6LGN490) incorporate feedback from Alex and Pete into URS (= Rev B).
        - [x] [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) Back-propagate any new requirements into the spreadsheet
    - [x] [@pete czerpak](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U06G77LEB52) review Rev B and provide feedback
    - [ ] Once this “Full URS” is drafted, we’ll propose a URS for an MVP based on criticality from Requirements spreadsheet
    - [x] **Mads to start FRS - Pete to provide template**
- [ ]     **Roadmap:**
    - [x]     [@Mads](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02Q6LGN490) will continue to build roadmap in ClickUp. Meeting scheduled with HW team owners for next Weds 12/10
        - [ ] Map requirements to product development stages
    - [ ] [@Will](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02NX8L4F5H) and [@Mads](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02Q6LGN490) to assess utility/feasibility at this stage of building Timeline in another system (e.g. Smartsheet, MS Project) to handle many cross-dependencies
- [ ]     **Misc**
    - [x] [@Will](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02NX8L4F5H) to follow up with Vidar on product vision & development process by EOW (meeting on Mon 12/8)
    - [x] [@Will](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U02NX8L4F5H) meeting with Vidar, Max, Mads re: FDA ETP & Raspberry engagement on Friday
    - [x] [@Alex Toda](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U06K9167K18) to educate HW team on typical control architecture for GMP HW systems (Mon 12/8)
- [ ]

## 2\\. Brief Progress Updates
> Each team member should briefly summarize their work since the last meeting, current focus, and next steps. Structure your update for clarity and decision-making—think “status, blockers, upcoming.” **Prioritize tangible outcomes, critical learnings, and any issues where you need input or support.** Be concise, concrete, and avoid generic statements.  
> \\- **What was completed:** List milestones, deliverables, or key advances since last update.  
> \\- **What’s in progress:** Share current activities, experiments, or problems you are solving.  
> \\- **Blockers/issues:** Surface anything impeding your work, requiring a decision, or posing risk to GMP, functionality, or timeline.  
> \\- I**mmediate next steps:** What you plan to tackle next, including deadlines if known.  
> This helps everyone quickly see progress, align dependencies, and spot risks early. Focus on actionable info over details for detail’s sake.
