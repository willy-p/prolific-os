### Questions:
*   What category of GMP does this device fall under? (medical device or other?)
*   Which regulations may apply to our device ? Any specifics for the illumination subsystem?
    *   we have identified the 21 CFR 11 and 211 requirements for electronics and data but there could be other things we don't yet know.
*   when is the best time to engage regulatory experts in these specific domains
*   How does equipment like an illuminator fit into the overall qualification process for a GMP facility? (it will impact the process, but not be process-contacting)
    *   Does equipment actually need to have a specific certification? Or just be qualified to do what it's supposed to do?

Advice category
*   where do first-time teams usually get wrong about the compliance element of development?

# Conversation notes
*   brief intro to eric about our tech
*   asking: how does a device like this fit into the regulatory / qualification process?
*   where does this fit in? TOX?
    *   we would move through the prcoess with the asset owner
*   start with preclinical, hoping to grow with the client through scale up / clinical trials
    *   in general: stirngency on gmp goes up as you go toward commercialization
    *   design with the end in mind
    *   plan for full gmp adherence = considerable
    *   can implement this in a phased manner over time.
    *   pre-clinical: everyone would ask for them, but a light lift compared to phase 3 etc
    *   considerations on the device apparatus + control modules,
    *   much more expensive to retrofit a system than to build with latent capabilities
    *   GMP = compliance documents. How strictly did we document everything about this material, process , machine... how strictly can we prove to someone else
    *   at least initially: fine to do phased implementation of \"GMPs\"
    *   certain aspects of device = not subject to GMP, just maintenance
*   cGMPs = practices plural
    *   gmp compliant vs GMPs

eric did scenario planning on different capital structuers
*   is the partner already GMP compliant? and to what extent?
    *   partner has already produced a molecule in a GMP fashion, and is either redoing the process with us to achieve performance, or doing the next molecule / integrating into their plant
    *   are they already FDA inspection? yes, sems like the most likely scenario vs a new startup cdmo
*   implement Prolific Quality Management System itno customer quality management system
    *   \"ways of working\" making sure you + your client \"mean the same things in your documentaiton\"
*   thinking about illuminator system for clinical
    *   finish+fill on site ? or is it contracted out ?
    *   what kind of testing will we be doing in a preclinical phase in terms of quality (measuring safety + efficacy)
*   clarification: existing CDMO running operations. we install their sytem (bioreactor accesory)- they run the process with this add on accessory illumination system. switch over to the next client and we pull stuff off
    *   physically remove the device
*   with using SUBs - most important thing is the PQs (and other Qs) and qualifying so you meet minimum performance specifications for the system. Plus extremely well written SOPs so that customers can run without you

example: SOP we checked that the light is loaded into the computer and it completes.
*   later: we check every 15 minutes that each LED is iluminating and the illumination level is consistent etc

equipment itself is not a GMP piece of equipment... but faiclity / process gets the gmp qualification. we ned to be set up properly to meet those standards
*   Nothing is GMP. everything is qualified to be GMP
*   GMP = Documentation level, to prove you know what you know to someone who doesn't know what you know
*   for non-gmp, you dont have to prove to other people what that means. you will qualify as GMP / subject to GMP
*   materials: certain alloys cannot be used because of corrosion / leaching
*   certain plastics . etc. those materials are essentially GMP because they have been vetted
*   all the operation / cleaning / stuff is set by us .

FDA emerging technology review happening in parallel
*   unique-to-this-system aspects of GMP qualification
*   before eric left prolific, he applied to emerging technology program = general applicability
*   priority, free review + FDA expertise, can take a bunch of meetings etc; but you have to get accepted
*   now we have access to all of these resources, predominantly \_\_\_\_
*   we are proposing how these things are subjected to GMPs
*   Vidar is running point on the Prolific side of things . generating documents and dossiers
*   got accepted 6-7 months ago . has been working with Vidar + team to start first meeting
    *   first meeting feedback will be very helpful
    *   somewhere in jan / feb to have this meeting with the fda
*   Vidar can share the application
*   what resources would you use for this?
    *   GFIs (guidance for industry) on different stages - based on the regulations, but easier to understand and digest
        *   Preclinical
        *   Good manufacturing guidance (FDA)
    *   Quality Management & Regulatory Teams of the target CDMO
        *   concern about level of development?
        *   you have to go in with a plan baked. you want them to review a plan rather than make one up , it would spook them if you dont have a plan.
            *   build up a dossier and set of documents for them to review - we need to decide (maybe via sequoia consulting)
                *   qualification program
                    *   validation data -→ Clarify with Eric what this means?
                *   SOPs
                *   ideally a point of contact who can speak their language (Alex for example, who can translate)

come up with a strategy for when we engage with lonza. what are the steps we need to take to be ready to start discussions with them?
*   Guiding question when deciding things such as which SOPs are ready: what needs to be done repeatably for the product to be produced without any issues?

### **GMP Regulatory Framework for Illuminator System**
*   GMP stringency increases as you get closer to commercialization
*   Need to plan for full GMP adherence from the start
    *   Can implement these in a phased manner over time
    *   Pre-clinical: GMP isn’t required, very light lift at this stage
    *   Much more expensive to retrofit than build early with latent capabilities
    *   GMPs are compliance documents - proving you know what you know to someone else
*   “Nothing is GMP - everything is qualified to be GMP”
    *   Documentation level determines compliance
    *   Equipment gets qualified for GMP use, not inherently GMP
### **Integration with CDMO Partners**
*   How to integrate Prolific Quality Management System into client QMS
    *   Must mean same things in documentation across organizations
    *   Partner scenarios: existing GMP-compliant CDMOs already FDA inspected
*   George previously did scenario planning around buy/build/partner capital structures
*   Hardest challenge: designing system for full commercial scale
*   Most important elements for our device:
    *   Performance qualifications (PQs) to meet standards and specs
    *   Well-documented SOPs so clients can run process without our intervention
*   Material considerations: certain alloys/plastics restricted due to corrosion/leaching risks
### **FDA Emerging Technology Program**
*   Prolific accepted 6-7 months ago into FDA program
*   Benefits: free priority review, access to full FDA expertise collective
*   Technology must have general/universal applicability
*   We get to propose how illuminator systems are regulated and subject to GMPs
*   Vidar running point from Prolific side, Eric from FDA side
*   First meeting targeted for January/February 2026
    *   Feedback will provide critical direction on unique-to-illuminator GMP requirements
    *   May include representatives from this hardware project
*   Vidar can share the accepted application (5-page document)
### **Regulatory Resources and Engagement Strategy**
*   Consult Guidance for Industries (GFIs) - don’t bother with raw regulations
    *   GFIs translate regulations into actionable guidance
    *   Focus on: good manufacturing guidance, pre-clinical guidance
*   Client engagement timing: need comprehensive plan before approaching CDMO regulatory teams
    *   Want them to react to our plan rather than design it
    *   Would spook partners if approached too early without preparedness
*   Required documentation before CDMO engagement:
    *   Qualification program with validation data
    *   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
    *   Point of contact who speaks quality language (like Alex)
*   Work with Sequoia QMS consultants to draft readiness dossier
### **SOP Development Requirements**
*   Example progression from pre-clinical to Phase 3:
    *   Pre-clinical: “Check light patterning program loads and completes”
    *   Phase 3: “Check every 15 minutes that each LED illuminates at proper luminance levels with documentation”
*   Key SOPs needed for repeatable production without quality issues:
    *   Installation procedures
    *   Testing protocols
    *   Maintenance procedures
    *   Calibration processes
### **Next Steps Strategy**
*   Develop strategy for Lonza engagement timeline
*   Define steps needed before initiating CDMO discussions
*   Coordinate with Vidar on FDA Emerging Technology Program integration
*   Align hardware development with overall regulatory roadmap
* * *
