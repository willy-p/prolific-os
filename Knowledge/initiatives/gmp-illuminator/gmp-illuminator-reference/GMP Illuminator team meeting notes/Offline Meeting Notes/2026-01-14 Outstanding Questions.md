Topics:
*       *   (1) What is the expected lifecycle of the first device? (Run once? Run 100 times? For a month? A year?)
    *   (2) Closed loop control - what is needed in the 1st device for this to be considered \"supported\" from hardware and software perspectives?
    *   (3) What is considered an HMI for our requirements? (is HMI strictly a touchscreen device? does a set of buttons and switches with a screen on it satisfy the term HMI? This should be defined)

Goal:
*   Align on answers to all 3 questions
*   Align on best method to codify these answers and best way to communicate them to the team.
