# Description
Meeting to discuss:
1. How can we involve the GMP Illuminator in the FDA Emerging Tech Program so we can get early feedback? 
    1. Vidar - Would love to understand if the illuminator is out of scope for this program, because Mads and I just learned about it from Eric last week.
2. What steps do we need to take to engage Lonza to get early feedback from them on our hardware system while presenting a clear, confidence-building plan for a compliant, working system.
    1. Max - what are the next steps for working with them? Any ongoing conversations related to scheduling a site visit that we should be aware of?
    2. Vidar - what are some of the risks you see with getting feedback from them on our designs, and how can we mitigate those?
# Notes
1. FDA ETP: background
    1. a way to interface with FDA before submitting IND/BLA
    2. putting together a doc focused on process that will be shared with them
        1. can be ok to add hardware to that
        2. we can include a list of specifications in narrative form
        3. vidar will share current prep doc

2\\. Lonza is a slow moving, cautious, etc company. So we want to avoid distracting them early on
*   BMGF = good place to source consultants who would review our assets before Lonza, who can help represent the likely needs / perspectives
*   Sensitivities from Lonza regarding our relationship
*   ongoing discussions
    1. \- what is required to build a partnership
    2. how can we incorporate altrubio partnership with Lonza?
        1. also separate discussions with altrubio
1. lonza contacts - they can bring us to Bend facility (only 50L R&D facility)
2. lonza typically moves very slow / highly regulated
3. they want to prevent us talking to other teams too early - derail partnership
4. Vidar is open to share info in early states - but only if it services the partnership
5. visit to Bend is a good first step
    1. Ask Brandon and Christian: who can review these requirements who is a safe sparring partner
*   someone on operations from Lonza should be on focus team with altrubio to talk about equipment specs

# Next Steps
1. [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) **:** schedule lonza site visit - bend
    1. delegation: vidar, max hu, mads, will, pete/alex, opto (?)…
        1. after that, decide whether we can get a partner within Lonza to give us feedback
    2. **decide later:** can we bring a high-level design for them to respond to?
2. [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) to ask his new point of contact from BMGF for regulatory/gmp consultant or partner
3. [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) get early feedback from a non-lonza CDMO / quality contact on our specs
    1. only share specs once they have been reviewed and look like something they would expect from an established equipment vendor
4. [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to share any updates re: three-way discussions with Lonza and Altru
5. [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to share updates from ETP meeting - add Will/Mads to channel if possible
