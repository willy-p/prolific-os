### **GMP Illuminator Project Overview**
*   GMP Illuminator needs to be on roadmap for Q3 2027 first clinical batch
    *   Unlikely case that Altrubio moves forward and we manufacture with them
    *   Alternative path would be Lonza or another partner for first demonstration
    *   **However- important to have this timeline on our roadmap to attract other customers. They need to see this.**
*   Key milestones for roadmap:
    *   Lock in requirements - when do we need to finalize specifications
    *   Lock in design - final design freeze timing
    *   Identify which requirements/specs need experimental validation
    *   Plan for execution of feasibility work
*   Phase 1 goal: assess feasibility and create high-level plan/architecture
    *   Phase 2 will work out details further
    *   Feasibility studies can run in parallel with Phase 1 and Phase 2
*   Likely in-scope for this project: tracking all feasibility work that needs to be done
    *   May not manage all feasibility work under this project
    *   Need clear dialogue on who makes decisions when feasibility timing doesn’t align
*   Vidar to share template for business case
### **Going over Charter**
*   Specifications - now explicitly high-level for Phase 1
    *   Phase 2 deliverables will be more refined specifications
    *   Cannot get final specifications in current timeframe
*   Optogenetic performance needs
    *   Performance as expected for first use cases with expandability for future use cases
    *   First version won’t do everything on scientific roadmap
    *   Modular design makes trade-offs easier
*   Out of scope items running in parallel:
    *   Physical build, testing, validation (not happening in Phase 1)
    *   Early prototyping and proof of concept work (Blastoise work feeding into design requirements)
    *   Max Huisman and Taylor to work on invention disclosures
        *   Max and Victor to align on finding outside counsel for hardware - holistic IP strategy
        *   Dennis wants something to show investors and board
        *   Modular illuminator concept probably patentable
    *   Max Hoerner wants to give early feedback on designs
        *   Will to check in in one month about this
        *   Max Hu still figuring out timelines and bandwidth
        *   Max Hu to set up quick, early session for next week
*   Team of SMEs (subject matter experts) and customer/user representatives for requirements refinement
*   Zach as main opto point of contact but overbooked
    *   Occasional meetings and reviewing material rather than weekly time commitment
    *   Will to propose specifications for Zach to own after Monday requirements review
    *   Taylor can be conduit for specifications from previous data/simulations
### **Deliverables and Timeline**
*   Added rationales for setting specifications based on George’s comments
*   Cost estimate split into two parts:
    *   Initial cost estimate for development of first unit
    *   Rough estimate of costs for subsequent units
    *   First prototype much more expensive than production units
    *   Development costs cover GMP readiness, documentation, software/firmware development
*   Timeline granularity concerns:
    *   Getting below one month granularity doesn’t make sense at this stage
    *   First two quarters should be planned at higher granularity for tracking progress
    *   1 week granularity for first 2 months of Phase 2
    *   Will to check with stakeholders on acceptable level of granularity before end of quarter
### **Key Technical Decisions**
*   Closed loop control currently scoped as upgradeable capability
    *   System architecture will support adding sensors and control – deliverable of Phase 1 will be product development roadmap which includes milestones for when we need to decide on incorporation of this feature and others (such as multi-color)
    *   Need certainty timeline for these features: e.g. 50% by end of Q1, 75% by end of Q3
*   Similar approach for other features (different LED colors, wavelengths)
    *   Design for future expansion rather than immediate implementation
    *   Important to know all relevant timelines that pertain to each of these features: biology, hardware, business case development
### **Strategic Alignment Discussion**
*   Need session with bio team on roadmap alignment
    *   What are first product use cases requiring multicolor control
    *   Timeline for when different capabilities needed
    *   Current hypothesis unclear on first product offering
*   Milestones for key decisions:
    *   When we need to know when things are ready (closed-loop control, multiple colors, specific wavelengths)
    *   What does it take to develop hardware/software technology for each scenario
    *   What does it take to develop biology for each scenario
    *   Understanding customer requirements for each capability
*   Vidar to add context/nuance on why Q3 2027 for GMP Illuminator to tech roadmap
*   Vidar to lead whiteboard session with bio team on roadmap (after Lonza visit)
*   Important to have GMP illuminator on roadmap even without immediate GMP run
    *   Gives customers confidence for onboarding cell line development projects in Q1
    *   Customers need to see plan and delivery confidence
### **Next Steps**
*   Will to send follow-up message after reviewing notes
*   Monthly steering committee meetings for project duration
    *   Next meeting in December
    *   January meeting
    *   Review all deliverables in early February
*   Will to clarify different types of milestones expected in draft plan:
    *   Delivery milestones
    *   Feasibility study conclusions
    *   Decision points
    *   Hiring/expertise acquisition
* * *
