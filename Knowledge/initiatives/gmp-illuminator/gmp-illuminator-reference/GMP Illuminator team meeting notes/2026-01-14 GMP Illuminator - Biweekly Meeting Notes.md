## 2\\. Brief Progress Updates
> Each team member should briefly summarize their work since the last meeting, current focus, and next steps. Structure your update for clarity and decision-making—think “status, blockers, upcoming.” **Prioritize tangible outcomes, critical learnings, and any issues where you need input or support.** Be concise, concrete, and avoid generic statements.  
> \\- **What was completed:** List milestones, deliverables, or key advances since last update.  
> \\- **What’s in progress:** Share current activities, experiments, or problems you are solving.  
> \\- **Blockers/issues:** Surface anything impeding your work, requiring a decision, or posing risk to GMP, functionality, or timeline.  
> \\- I**mmediate next steps:** What you plan to tackle next, including deadlines if known.  
> This helps everyone quickly see progress, align dependencies, and spot risks early. Focus on actionable info over details for detail’s sake.
