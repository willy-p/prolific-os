*   Suggestion from Max: more milestone granularity for things like: customer signed, site confirmed, reactor type and volume confirmed (and what specifications will need to be locked based on these milestones)
    *   follow-up with Vidar about this

*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) - add process development branch for acceptance testing at customer
