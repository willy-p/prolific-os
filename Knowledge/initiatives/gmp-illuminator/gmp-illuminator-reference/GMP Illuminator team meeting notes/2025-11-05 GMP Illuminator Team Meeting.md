### **1\\. Quick Roundtable – Feedback on the Process**
*   How did the requirements process feel?
*   Anything missing or unclear in the spreadsheet structure?
*   Any suggestions before we move into spec definition?
*   Mads: Fun. Confusing: requirements spanned different levels (e.g. how much memory we have is intertwined with other specs)
*   Pete: 8/33 still need spec plan. Many requirements won't result in a spec - e.g. traceability of harware components. Rating by individual groups can be problematic
*   Vidar: requirements at all levels of system - would be helpful to separate requirements by level and component. suggestion to rank at system level first and see how it cascades into lower-level system requirements.
*   Max: for final specs, one architect should be responsible for ranking all of the specs. Some comments on charter - different opinions on what should be in scope for this phase of project.
*   Zack: want to make sure we are determining requirements / specs here and may not be solving them as part of this project.
### **2\\. Discussion – “Big” Requirements**
*   Which requirements feel especially large, complex, or cross-functional?
*   Any that seem too ambiguous or under-defined?
*   Are there dependencies that make them difficult to move forward on?

*   \"Ensure GMP compliance\"
    *   this is vague, needs to be broken down into specifics
*   Usable within a cleanroom - need to define what this means
*   21 CFR Part 11 Compliance - what does this mean?
*   _Max has had conversations with Iggy, whose company manufactures and sells GMP-compliant bioreactor. Did this within a year. Max getting in touch with their engineer who led the effort._
    *   We need to determine who on our team will become the expert.
*   COGS target
    *   starting with end in mind - what can this cost, how can we engineer it to meet those costs. need to align with broader TEA, what customers are willing to pay
*   Requirements that are facility-dependent
    *   e.g. vibration tolerance - will this be close to a centrifuge?
    *   many requirements in this area - specifics of how it is installed / where it is installed. portability , modularity make this extra challenging.
*   Testing plan to make sure this fulfills our specs
    *   number of engineering runs required cuts into the time we have to design and build this product.
*   long-term business case for the project
    *   what will we sell it for? what is budget for the product?
### **3\\. Writing Effective Specifications -** [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   Guidance on translating requirements into measurable, testable specifications
*   Common pitfalls to avoid
*   Examples from other GMP or hardware projects

*   GAMP V
    *   shows how requirements flow to specs, all the way down to validation
*   recommend not to get into too much detail right away
*   traceability - logical structure for how we write the requirements
*   documentation should be used to generate a validation package for how we define for GMP
*   separate out requirements
    *   early - build architecture picture for high-level components and how they come together
    *   build WBS - how do requirements break down into element specs, sub-specs
*   think about what types of FMEAs to do - for design specs
*   rec from Pete: \"Design for six sigma\"
*   requirements and design specs should be version-controlled
*   
### **4\\. Next Steps & Sprint Plan**
*   **Focus for this sprint (Nov 6–19):**
    *   Identify external info sources or data needed to define specs
    *   Flag where consultant or SME input is required
    *   Add notes or links in the “External Inputs” tab
    *   Max, Mads & Will: finalize top-priority requirements to define first
    *   Confirm any open questions or resource needs
    *   Timeline and resource needs for building the GMP Illuminator
        *   **Build in plan for a plan.**
