# Device name: _Pikachu_

Explain here why the device was given the name that it has. In this case, [**Pikachu**](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pikachu_(Pokémon)) was chosen because it has the most well-recognized Pokémon and therefore serves great as a stand-in for a template.

# Stakeholder Interview Documentation DEVICES TEMPLATE

This is a rough, largely unformatted document for the purposes of extended note taking during user interviews. In an effort to focus more time on learning and listening with careful record taking, formality is sacrificed for the sake of capturing an honest representation of the interviews. 

An example of interview notes are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JEhuPcirG9XfiEelIiHIO4ty2eYVIUWQ0l4N0-gK2VA/edit?usp=sharing) (note this is from several years ago).

# Pre-Interview Prep
1. Define a quick mission statement
    1. Begin with a mission statement: briefly define the goal without presenting a solution concept. Only define the apparent opportunity.
2. Gather Information: Combination of online research and field work.
    1. Research currently available solutions and the baseline technological feasibility / groundwork
    2. Get to know and profile the end-users of your product. Who are they? What are the current solutions they use, if any? What needs do they have? Ask about the problems they face, have them discuss what they do & don’t like.

# Interview Notes

**Information to gather:**
*   Background information - "teach me about your experience with this so far"
    *   Discuss the problems they are having that may be solved by this device
    *   Discuss their expertise / what they may know about the requirements
*   Ask open ended questions and encourage them to share every single thing that comes to mind.
    *   Aspirations for the device
        *   Important tasks they need it to perform
        *   What do they see as the primary function
        *   How do they envision using it
    *   Risks / Issues
        *   What are the main drawbacks they foresee
        *   What is the biggest risk you foresee
        *   What are the biggest obstacles and challenges you see
    *   Further Probing
        *   Would it fit to have \_\_\_ functionality
        *   Does this functionality remind you of anything else? How are they connected?

**_Your job as an Interviewer:_**
1. _Obtain maximum information that will help to inform device requirements so that the device can meet its value-adding objectives._
2. _Provide a safe and welcoming environment to encourage people to be thoughtful and honest._
3. _Speak as little as possible and invite your interviewee to speak as much as possible, with the following exceptions:_
    1. _To ask prompting questions_
    2. _To ask follow up or clarification questions_
    3. _To gently guide away from “zoning in” on specific aspects for the purposes of time management (keep a balance between breadth and depth)_

# Device Needs Register TEMPLATE

**Definition**:
Needs are the fundamental problems or desires of the user or stakeholder that the product is intended to address. They are high-level and often expressed in plain language.
**Characteristics**:
*   Broad and abstract.
*   Usually not tied to a specific solution.
*   Focus on the "why" behind the product.

You will translate stakeholder interviews into needs on this page. An example of a needs analysis is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4Djsa75AlFMm5BiTae4mvZYte7wuP5xcKfe7X2XB_c/edit?usp=sharing)

# Part 1: Writing the Needs Statements

5 Guidelines for writing needs statements:
1. “What” not “How”
    1. “I would like my iPhone to adjust my thermostat” → The thermostat can be controlled remotely without a special device
2. Specificity
    1. “I have different heating and cooling systems” → The thermostat can control separate heating and cooling system
3. Positive not Negative
    1. “I get tired of standing in front of my thermostat to program it” → The thermostat is programmable from a comfortable position
4. An attribute of the product
    1. “I have to manually override my program if I’m home when I shouldn’t be” → The thermostat automatically responds to an occupant’s presence
5. Avoid “Must” and “Should”
    1. “I’m worried about how secure my thermostat would be if it is accessible online” → The thermostat controls are secure from unauthorized access

(Compile a list of needs here)
# Part 2: Create an ordered List of Needs

1. Organize the needs list into primary, secondary, and latent categories
    1. Latent needs are needs that were not expressly identified by the user but are apparent upon deeper inspection to be an important component of the solution
    2. Needs are ordered from most important to least important. Reserve judging any two needs as equally important. Instead, focus on making decisions with users about the relative importance of each need.

# Part 3: Share the Needs with Stakeholders and get Feedback

1. Reflect on the needs statements and bring them to users. Ask questions to ensure that you’ve captured their needs fully and appropriately.

# Device Requirements Register DEVICES TEMPLATE

Device Requirements sit between Device Needs and Device Specifications.

**Definition**:
Requirements translate the needs into actionable and measurable objectives. They describe what the product must do to fulfill the needs.
**Characteristics**:
*   More specific and detailed than needs.
*   Divided into different types, such as **functional**, **non-functional**, **user**, and **business requirements**.
*   Serve as a foundation for design and testing.
**Examples**:
*   The product must automate mixing cycles and handle up to 5 liters of liquid.
*   The system must operate at a pH range of 3 to 10.
*   The product must reduce contamination to less than 0.01% per batch.

###   

*   **Instructions**
    
    The following requirements are supplemented by the [prototype device requirements](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/dc/12h8j1-26311/12h8j1-36391) shared by all prolific prototype devices.
    
      
    
    Requirements are detailed descriptions of what the project needs to achieve in terms of features, functions, and capabilities. They are specifications that outline the criteria to be met for the project to be successful. The requirements capture what the key deliverable(s) should be capable of doing and what it needs to be compatible with. Deliverables besides the key deliverable (e.g. intermediate results, subassemblies, plans, etc.) are layed out in the next section.

# IP and FTO Considerations DEVICES TEMPLATE

_Edited from Emily Gale's Version_

**Note:** completion of this section may take significant time. We expect project architects to spend anywhere from 1-7 days working on this depending on the number of tools/innovations. In some cases, there will not be any IP/FTO considerations. If you think that is the case, meet with Max to verify this assumption before skipping this section.

**List all potentially patentable tools/innovations that will result from this work**
1. XX
2. YY
3. ZZ

**Complete a high level search of existing art related to the above tools/innovations** 
Search for patents (e.g. in Google Patents) and papers that may relate to the ideas, approaches and possible inventions in this project. This could for example include attempts to solve a similar problem by a different method, the use of similar tools for a different purpose, or tools you are attempting to improve on. 
In the table below, list each reference or patent number together with a **plain, factual statement** that briefly summarizes the relevant aspect - for instance “Uses a tetracyclin-inducible expression system to express an enzyme for improved flavor”. **Do not give an opinion on how it relates to our proposed invention** \- it will later be shared with our lawyers who will make that assessment.
It does not need to be exhaustive at this time, but you should still expect this to take quite some time - a day or two is not unreasonable.

| **Reference or patent number** | **Summary** |
| ---| --- |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |

**Complete a tool inventory**
In the space below, list all the tools and methods you plan to use in the project, together with links to relevant literature, patents or catalogue numbers (this may also take considerable time, perhaps ≈ 1 day per tool in more complex cases). The previous section was concerned with the concepts and inventive ideas in what the project is aiming at, which could potentially be achieved in different ways. Here we are concerned with what concrete tools and methods we are actually planning to use - for instance, what starting cell line, what integration methods (such as specific transposons or integrases), what expression systems. This is to enable the lawyers to make an assessment of any FTO considerations or licensing needs there might be with our strategy if we ever want to commercialize it, and enable us to tweak our experimental plan if needed.

**Schedule an IP check-in meeting**
Schedule a meeting with all relevant stakeholders including those listed below:
1. **Max**: key decision maker that needs to sign-off on the plan
2. **Project/product manager**: determine product requirements and commercialization strategy and risks when relevant
3. **Project architect**: gathers the information listed above

**Proposed agenda:**
1. Discuss the information listed above and the implications for the project
2. Identify all IP/FTO risks related to the project (**discuss these, but do not write them down**)
3. Create an action plan to address these risks. Depending on the project, the specific actions and timing they need to be taken may vary greatly. Actions may include:
    1. Completing IDFs for one or more technologies (~0.5-1 day)
    2. Adjusting the scientific approach and/or scope
    3. Scheduling meetings with IP lawyers
    4. Deciding whether to conduct further IP searches internally
    5. Deciding whether to pursue a more comprehensive FTO search (several days/tool)
4. Use this document to summarize the meeting output, including next steps

### **Executive summary**

Prolific Machines is launching the GMP Illuminator Project to define specifications and a development plan for a **modular, GMP-compatible illuminator** for single-use bioreactors (50–2,000 L). This planning phase will deliver system requirements, workstreams, and a roadmap to ensure regulatory compliance and reliable optogenetic activation of customer cell lines. As a **top-priority project for Q4**, success will de-risk Prolific with customers and investors and lay the foundation for prototype builds and commercial deployment.

#   

# **Background and Business Case**

## Strategic alignment

How this project advances company objectives (e.g., supports platform validation, accelerates regulatory readiness, strengthens IP position, reduces COGS, etc.).

To produce customer products at clinical and commercial scales, Prolific must develop illuminators that are fully **fit for production environments**—which, in practice, means achieving **GMP compatibility**. This represents one of the most stringent requirements we face and marks a new level of sophistication for the company, making “GMP” a useful shorthand for the standard we must reach. Delivering these illuminators on time, with the right performance and quality, is critical not only to meeting customer expectations but also to demonstrating Prolific’s ability to operate at commercial scale. Successfully doing so will significantly de-risk the company in the eyes of both customers and investors, strengthening confidence in our platform and future growth.

# **Goals and Success Criteria**

## High-level goal

1-2 sentences - example: “Demonstrate reproducible optogenetic control across cell lines and reactors, enabling translation of illumination conditions with defined accuracy.”

Define the **system specifications**, **scope parameters**, and a **credible development plan** for a GMP-compatible modular illuminator that supports optogenetic protein production in single-use bioreactors (SUBs).

This charter covers only the initial planning/specification phase. Execution (prototype builds, validation, certification) will be chartered separately.

**Key deliverables for this phase** (see [timelines & key milestones](http://#timeline-&-key-milestones) for details):

*   Documented specifications for a GMP illuminator system.
*   High level business case (draft) including estimate of development cost, unit cost and pricing (to be updated & refined in the next phase)
*   Proposed workstream structure (e.g. hardware, software, integration, regulatory).
*   Rough development timeline from prototype through GMP-ready version(s) for the first customer(s) with high level resourcing estimates.

## Success criteria

*   Quantifiable targets (e.g., “≥90% reproducibility in illumination translation between embodiments”).
*   Milestone-driven metrics (e.g., “validated SOPs for cytometry within 6 months”).
*   Clear deliverables (e.g., “dataset available in \[database/tool\] by \[date\]”).

*   Consensus across stakeholders on specification set with GO from all stakeholders in meeting.
*   Draft plan and milestones approved by sponsor and leadership.
*   Specifications align with SUB compatibility, scale range, regulatory expectations, and optogenetic performance needs

# **Scope**

## Business Case
### Purpose
*   Instructions
    
    Roughly what is it that you are proposing? Write a sentence or short paragraph and keep in mind not to focus on any specific embodiment at this point.
    
    Example: _The goal of Dratini is to serve as a scale-down version of a larger external illuminator used with stainless steel reactors (200L+)._
    

### The need and impact of the proposed project
*   Instructions
    
    Which capabilities does this device enable? Which projects or work streams stand to benefit and how? Answer in a short list or paragraph.
    

### What company OKR is this related to?
*   Instructions
    
    List the company OKR that this device is contributing to. If possible, use the click up link to the OKR. Also include projects that this device is delivering toward more directly if applicable.
    

### Risk(s) of not pursuing the project
*   Instructions
    
    Create a short list of risks of not pursuing this project. What device or technique will be used instead if this device is not created? What work will be delayed / what will the resulting impact be on the company/project OKRs?

# Device Documentation

This is where all notes on designs considerations, planning, testing and other experiments are organized. Use this page to describe the available resources, notes and data at a high level and point to sub-pages that contain the details notes.

# Prototyping Documentation



# Proof of Concept

This page documents the **proof of concept stage**: this stage includes concept design and testing of crucial aspects, without going into detailed design. Once all key concepts have been sufficiently de-risked (as part of the plan below), the first prototype can be built.
_Note that the target timing is based on a project of 'medium complexity', assuming the project is someone's main focus._

# Device Specifications Register TEMPLATE

**Definition**:
Specifications are the technical and detailed instructions that describe how the requirements will be implemented. They serve as a blueprint for building and verifying the product.
**Characteristics**:
*   Highly detailed and precise.
*   Include metrics, tolerances, and technical details.
*   Can be found in engineering drawings, code, or manufacturing documents.
**Examples**:
*   The mixing blade will operate at a speed of 300 RPM, powered by a 1.5 kW motor.
*   The bioreactor's chamber will be made of 316L stainless steel with a wall thickness of 1.5 mm.
*   The control software will use a PID algorithm to regulate temperature within ±0.5°C.

# Part 1:

Specifications are handled twice and have different goals each time:
1. Target Specifications
    1. A translation of needs with aspirational goals
2. Final Specifications
    1. Fine-tuned after generating/developing/testing the concept further
    2. These are the specifications that the team commits to deliver

Questions to consider when writing specifications:
1. How will we measure it?
2. What is the right value in those measurable terms?

A specification has 3 parts: Metric, Value, and Unit

Each need must be translated into a metric, though some metrics address multiple needs. This doesn’t have a value yet, just determine what will be measured.

| Needs |
| --- |
| # | Subject | Need | Importance |
| 1 | The coffee | Is easy to digest | 2 |
| 2 | The coffee | Dissolves easily in water | 1 |
| 3 | The coffee | Doesn’t perish quickly | 3 |
| 4 | The coffee | Is affordable | 1 |

| Metrics |
| --- |
| # | Needs # | Metric | Imp | Units |
| 1 | 1, 2 | pH of dissolved coffee | 2 | (pH) |
| 2 | 2, 3 | Moisture / water content | 1 | w/w % |
| 3 | 4 | Price of 1 serving (2 tsp) coffee | 1 | $ |

Specifications are handled twice and have different goals each time:
1. Target Specifications
    1. A translation of needs with aspirational goals
2. Final Specifications
    1. Fine-tuned after generating/developing/testing the concept further
    2. These are the specifications that the team commits to deliver

Questions to consider when writing specifications:
1. How will we measure it?
2. What is the right value in those measurable terms?

A specification has 3 parts: Metric, Value, and Unit

Benchmarking: Process implemented to determine what values should qualify as “within specification”
Benchmarking can be achieved based on user needs or based on on-market solutions. Marginal Values are barely good enough, and Ideal values are aspirational goals.
Here is an example of Target Specifications. Working Specifications are similar except only one value is specified and it is the value that the team feels can be delivered at that time in the product’s development life cycle.

| Metric # | Needs # | Metric | Imp | Units | Marginal Value | Ideal Value | Competitor 1 Amt | Competitor 1 User Rating | Competitor 2 Amt | Competitor 2 User Rating |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 1 | 1, 2 | pH of dissolved coffee | 2 | (pH) | 5 | 6 | 5 | \*\*\* | 5.5 | \*\*\*\*\* |
| 2 | 2, 3 | Moisture / water content | 1 | w/w % | 8 | 5 | 6 | \*\*\*\* | 10 | \*\* |
| 3 | 4 | Price of 2 tsp coffee | 1 | $ | .1 | .05 | .1 | \*\*\* | .07 | \*\*\*\* |

Specification Tradeoffs!
*   A lot of specifications have to be traded off against cost, when the cost of the improvement is too high for viability. Another example could be robustness vs portability.
*   Different solution concepts will navigate the tradeoffs differently. It is important to map solution concepts relative to each other on the most vital metrics.

Specifications cascade into subsystems. System specifications are direct translations of user needs. 

These specifications then guide the sub-system specifications, which lead to the component-level specifications, manufacturing-level specifications, and process-level specifications.

# Prototype v1

This page documents the **first prototype version**: this comprises the first device that is ready for integration and testing. If additional development cycles are necessary after testing the first testing/integration phase, a new prototype 'version' (with its own documentation page) is created.

# 2025-10-29 GMP Illuminator Standup



# 2025-11-05 GMP Illuminator Team Meeting

### **1\. Quick Roundtable – Feedback on the Process**
*   How did the requirements process feel?
*   Anything missing or unclear in the spreadsheet structure?
*   Any suggestions before we move into spec definition?
*   Mads: Fun. Confusing: requirements spanned different levels (e.g. how much memory we have is intertwined with other specs)
*   Pete: 8/33 still need spec plan. Many requirements won't result in a spec - e.g. traceability of harware components. Rating by individual groups can be problematic
*   Vidar: requirements at all levels of system - would be helpful to separate requirements by level and component. suggestion to rank at system level first and see how it cascades into lower-level system requirements.
*   Max: for final specs, one architect should be responsible for ranking all of the specs. Some comments on charter - different opinions on what should be in scope for this phase of project.
*   Zack: want to make sure we are determining requirements / specs here and may not be solving them as part of this project.
### **2\. Discussion – “Big” Requirements**
*   Which requirements feel especially large, complex, or cross-functional?
*   Any that seem too ambiguous or under-defined?
*   Are there dependencies that make them difficult to move forward on?

*   "Ensure GMP compliance"
    *   this is vague, needs to be broken down into specifics
*   Usable within a cleanroom - need to define what this means
*   21 CFR Part 11 Compliance - what does this mean?
*   _Max has had conversations with Iggy, whose company manufactures and sells GMP-compliant bioreactor. Did this within a year. Max getting in touch with their engineer who led the effort._
    *   We need to determine who on our team will become the expert.
*   COGS target
    *   starting with end in mind - what can this cost, how can we engineer it to meet those costs. need to align with broader TEA, what customers are willing to pay
*   Requirements that are facility-dependent
    *   e.g. vibration tolerance - will this be close to a centrifuge?
    *   many requirements in this area - specifics of how it is installed / where it is installed. portability , modularity make this extra challenging.
*   Testing plan to make sure this fulfills our specs
    *   number of engineering runs required cuts into the time we have to design and build this product.
*   long-term business case for the project
    *   what will we sell it for? what is budget for the product?
### **3\. Writing Effective Specifications -** [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   Guidance on translating requirements into measurable, testable specifications
*   Common pitfalls to avoid
*   Examples from other GMP or hardware projects

*   GAMP V
    *   shows how requirements flow to specs, all the way down to validation
*   recommend not to get into too much detail right away
*   traceability - logical structure for how we write the requirements
*   documentation should be used to generate a validation package for how we define for GMP
*   separate out requirements
    *   early - build architecture picture for high-level components and how they come together
    *   build WBS - how do requirements break down into element specs, sub-specs
*   think about what types of FMEAs to do - for design specs
*   rec from Pete: "Design for six sigma"
*   requirements and design specs should be version-controlled
*   
### **4\. Next Steps & Sprint Plan**
*   **Focus for this sprint (Nov 6–19):**
    *   Identify external info sources or data needed to define specs
    *   Flag where consultant or SME input is required
    *   Add notes or links in the “External Inputs” tab
    *   Max, Mads & Will: finalize top-priority requirements to define first
    *   Confirm any open questions or resource needs
    *   Timeline and resource needs for building the GMP Illuminator
        *   **Build in plan for a plan.**

#### [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
*   **Regulatory:** started compiling information on reg requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CJMg-7giT7AxWMYj3W02WvCunECs4Hlc7AmGfwx6tI/edit?usp=sharing) (oops looks like Will and I did some overlapping things)

*   **Consultant Process Suggestion:** [here](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C09LMT2NPNG/p1763416644873269)
*   Current Focus: Getting feedback on the above work as this is new for me :-). Then working on the URS/FRS and engaging consultants.
#### [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042)
*   Met with [@Taylor Hinsdale](#user_mention#75430548) to discuss opto requirements; [@Taylor Hinsdale](#user_mention#75430548) will share updated key requirement.
*   Reached out to SOSV channels to find GMP consultants (no replies yet)
*   Met with Lonza team to request access to people/facilities that could help us design with their testing/install requirements in mind. They're open to helping; will follow up this week.
*   Secured ~10k$ for GMP consultant(s) in phase 1.
#### [@Taylor Hinsdale](#user_mention#75430548)
*   Met with [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) to discuss opto requirements. Updated the key requirement that will need input from opto team when defining the specifications.
*   Finalizing work statement of work for CFD consultant to enable GMP illuminator specification definition for scale implementations.

#### [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421)
*   Productive Lonza meeting overal, in terms of GMP input, it became clear that we need input from different teams within Lonza and that there is a delicate balance between involving those teams to early - triggering risk perception - and involving them to late. We agreed to organize a site visit and share the hardware roadmap with the Lonza team to they can start to discuss internally
*   [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) will follow up on the visit with the Lonza team - depending on timing, we could ask them to be connected with some people on the operations side earlier.
*   WuXi highlighted a couple of key points:
    *   Simple light patterns would be important to them - he suggested a limited number of set points
    *   Reinforced the importance of risk management - i.e. ensuring that we're actually delivering the amount of light that we want to deliver.
#### [@Pete czerpak](#user_mention#75430545)
*   Shared [URS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tt-lvEFyMJ7yNlarC6_T0NaN9lZjXAtE?usp=share_link) (NIIMBL, Biophorum) resources with team that are perhaps better starting point than ISPE one that Mads originally used
*   Reviewed list of GMP/Regulatory activities from clickup. Commentary..... IQ is usually the simplest/shortest and is mostly an inspection and review of drawings/documentation to make sure what is supplied is as stated and that appropriate connections to exterior systems is as required. OQ and PQ is where it gets serious (and lengthy).
*   We have a Sartorius IQ/OQ and Functional Spec set of documentation from the 50STR that are relevant and can be reviewed by the team to better understand the level of what is supplied. Only supplied as paper version. These are likely based on GAMP design of the system based on format used and how system is broken down.
*   Put together [list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNjQT38jHX3lMu4SXa0olr9stO1JXCgZ/view?usp=share_link) of GMP bioprocess equipment and controller hardware/software to show the standardization already in the industry and where confidence is held and how other software and controllers may be viewed as unproven.
#### [@Zack Harmer](#user_mention#75447684)
*   Blastoise run ongoing planned to end next Monday (11/24)

## **Additional Notes:**
_Miscellaneous updates, reminders, or open floor discussion items._
*   Should we only be focusing on US for first launch? At what point do we need to decide?
    *   When talking to GMP consultants, get someone with an EU/UK lens.
*   WuXi would be concerned with many changes in the light pattern - "profile complexity"

### Review of Progress
*   System architecture document completed and shared for team feedback
    *   High-level architecture intentionally kept broad to avoid refactoring subsystems as specifications develop
    *   Red box represents system envelope of components being developed (excludes bag holder, backup controller which remain unmodified)
    *   Four main subsystems identified: controller, environment management, sensors, and illumination
    *   Will adjust visual presentation to clearly label all subsystems for clarity
*   User Requirements Specification (URS) development in progress
    *   Madeleine leading with Vidar as backup
    *   Draft URS document ready for review
    *   Review meeting scheduled for week after Thanksgiving with Will, Madeleine, Alex, and Pete
*   Regulatory and qualification framework established
    *   Comprehensive ClickUp list created covering pre-qualification through performance qualification phases
    *   Process includes documentation strategy for requirements traceability
    *   Framework covers design qualification (DQ), installation qualification (IQ), operational qualification (OQ), and performance qualification (PQ)
### Key Achievements
*   Taylor refined optical specifications requirements
    *   Redefined light delivery requirements focusing on stability, precision, and accuracy
    *   Working with Zack and internal team to determine if sufficient internal data exists for specifications
*   Cost estimation completed at high-level magnitude
    *   Matthew delivered preliminary cost breakdown
    *   Requirements successfully organized into prioritized buckets for development phases
*   Consultant outreach strategy finalized
    *   Process established: non-confidential outreach → initial fit assessment → contract/NDA → concept sharing → group consultation
    *   Multiple consultant contacts identified across regulatory, compliance, and bioprocess expertise areas
### Challenges and Adjustments Needed
*   Jurisdictional scope decision required
    *   Team debating whether to focus solely on US FDA requirements for first launch or include EU regulations
    *   Concern that developing for US-only may miss simpler EU requirements or create compatibility issues
    *   Max recommends focusing on US initially with early consultant input on expansion complexity
    *   Decision point needed before alpha development to avoid fundamental design incompatibilities
*   WuXi expressed concern about light pattern complexity
    *   Feedback indicates preference for limited profile complexity
    *   May require constraining system to preset recipes rather than full control system capabilities
    *   Need to balance customer requirements with system complexity
*   Architecture communication clarity needed
    *   Current visual presentation caused confusion about subsystem boundaries
    *   Firmware distribution across multiple controllers not clearly represented
    *   Need to clarify whether bioprocess industry standards apply to firmware implementation
*   Requirements change control process undefined
    *   Question whether formal document control system needed from start or if spreadsheet/ClickUp sufficient
    *   Industry standards may require change control from beginning of development
### Action Items and Accountability for the Week Ahead
*   Max: Draft non-confidential outreach message for consultants by end of week
*   Will: Schedule URS review meeting for week after Thanksgiving with Madeleine, Alex, and Pete
*   Will: Update system architecture diagram to clearly label software and sensors as subsystems
*   Madeleine: Reach out to consultant contacts using approved outreach process
    *   Note: Anyone working for customers must check with Max before outreach
*   Team: Provide feedback on URS tab 2 (not tab 1 which is incomplete)
*   Ryan: Research common communication protocols in bioprocess industry (ModBus, etc.)
    *   Team: Consider GAMP and ISO 88 standards for bioprocess control systems
*   Follow-up needed: Determine if Eric Schultz can provide regulatory framework guidance
*   Follow-up needed: Explore Matt’s previous experience with requirements change control systems at Apple
*   All: Review team updates asynchronously due to time constraints

*   Document Change Control
    *   Typical requirement/spec process: URS → FRS → HDS / SDS
        *   URS: user requirement specs
        *   FRS: functional '' ''
        *   HDS: hardware '' ''
        *   SDS: software '' ''
    *   Right now, only working on URS and FRS. FRS will be used to make design specs
        *   After feedback has been incorporated into URS, do a full pass ( [@Pete czerpak](#user_mention#75430545) )
    *   All specs will be migrated to Google Docs & google sheet will be deprecated

    *   Versioning:
        *   Right now, everything is "REV A" (moving to B, C, D, etc.)
        *   Once we move into official version control, will start at REV 0 → 1, 2, 3, ...
    *   ~~No requirements management tool will be used at this stage.~~ Will revisit once Phase 1 is complete
        *   Conversation with sales team at Jama Connect - would cost ≥$20k/year for our team
        *   Discuss other options.
            *   Next step: reach out to a system engineer (<15 min) to ask their opinion whether we need a requirements management system at this stage [@Taylor Hinsdale](#user_mention#75430548) [@Pete czerpak](#user_mention#75430545) [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
                *   Other options: traceCloud, IBM DOORS, Cameo MBSE
            *   [@Taylor Hinsdale](#user_mention#75430548) **to create a list of options with approx. pricing**

*   No response from A&B on requirements tracking software
* * *
## 3\. Requirements & Specification Alignment
*   _Recent changes or clarifications (reference URS/SRS/TRS as appropriate)._
*   _Open requirements or unresolved specification questions._
*   _Impacts on project plan or risk profile._

*   There's lots of information in the Requirements List spreadsheet that is not captured in the URS (related to priority / criticality)
*   Review of URS - just a format that biopharma people are used to seeing. not inclusive enough right now for us to use
*   Does this need an HMI? (add to questions list)
*   what are different requirements / features critical to? (e.g. functionality, regulatory compliance, user expectations, ...)
*   **Next step:** map **critical** requirements to different stages of product development process
    *   Validate assumptions for anything where we are not 100% confident of requirements
    *   Involve Vidar in this process. Ask Vidar to document product vision and buy in to requirements / features.
*   Draft a URS for the MVP - URS with non-critical features crossed out. Clearly communicate what features / requirements will not be included in this initial product.
    *   This is what will be feasible for initial product release _with what we know now_

**URS Plan:**
*   Mads incorporates feedback
*   Pete reviews
*   Incorporate feedback again
*   URS release to team
*   Team reviews URS, xref with requirements list, suggests which requirements to drop
*   Share original URS with "minimum viable URS" with Vidar and Max

* * *
## 4\. Blockers & Key Risks
*   _Current issues impacting pace, scope, or compliance._
*   _Risks requiring escalation or resolution this week._
* * *
## 5\. GMP & CDMO Operations Feedback
*   _CDMO partner feedback (compliance, operability, validation)._
*   _Usability observations, operator feedback._
* * *
## 6\. Dependencies
*   _Updates or needed inputs from partners, vendors, other teams._
*   _Resource or decision dependencies._
* * *
## 7\. Next Steps & Accountability

# 2025-11-07 Steering Committee Meeting

Fri, 07 Nov 25 · [max@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max@prolific-machines.com), [max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com), [victor@prolific-machines.com](mailto:victor@prolific-machines.com), [vidar@prolific-machines.com](mailto:vidar@prolific-machines.com), [alex.toda@prolific-machines.com](mailto:alex.toda@prolific-machines.com)
### **GMP Illuminator Project Overview**
*   GMP Illuminator needs to be on roadmap for Q3 2027 first clinical batch
    *   Unlikely case that Altrubio moves forward and we manufacture with them
    *   Alternative path would be Lonza or another partner for first demonstration
    *   **However- important to have this timeline on our roadmap to attract other customers. They need to see this.**
*   Key milestones for roadmap:
    *   Lock in requirements - when do we need to finalize specifications
    *   Lock in design - final design freeze timing
    *   Identify which requirements/specs need experimental validation
    *   Plan for execution of feasibility work
*   Phase 1 goal: assess feasibility and create high-level plan/architecture
    *   Phase 2 will work out details further
    *   Feasibility studies can run in parallel with Phase 1 and Phase 2
*   Likely in-scope for this project: tracking all feasibility work that needs to be done
    *   May not manage all feasibility work under this project
    *   Need clear dialogue on who makes decisions when feasibility timing doesn’t align
*   Vidar to share template for business case
### **Going over Charter**
*   Specifications - now explicitly high-level for Phase 1
    *   Phase 2 deliverables will be more refined specifications
    *   Cannot get final specifications in current timeframe
*   Optogenetic performance needs
    *   Performance as expected for first use cases with expandability for future use cases
    *   First version won’t do everything on scientific roadmap
    *   Modular design makes trade-offs easier
*   Out of scope items running in parallel:
    *   Physical build, testing, validation (not happening in Phase 1)
    *   Early prototyping and proof of concept work (Blastoise work feeding into design requirements)
    *   Max Huisman and Taylor to work on invention disclosures
        *   Max and Victor to align on finding outside counsel for hardware - holistic IP strategy
        *   Dennis wants something to show investors and board
        *   Modular illuminator concept probably patentable
    *   Max Hoerner wants to give early feedback on designs
        *   Will to check in in one month about this
        *   Max Hu still figuring out timelines and bandwidth
        *   Max Hu to set up quick, early session for next week
*   Team of SMEs (subject matter experts) and customer/user representatives for requirements refinement
*   Zach as main opto point of contact but overbooked
    *   Occasional meetings and reviewing material rather than weekly time commitment
    *   Will to propose specifications for Zach to own after Monday requirements review
    *   Taylor can be conduit for specifications from previous data/simulations
### **Deliverables and Timeline**
*   Added rationales for setting specifications based on George’s comments
*   Cost estimate split into two parts:
    *   Initial cost estimate for development of first unit
    *   Rough estimate of costs for subsequent units
    *   First prototype much more expensive than production units
    *   Development costs cover GMP readiness, documentation, software/firmware development
*   Timeline granularity concerns:
    *   Getting below one month granularity doesn’t make sense at this stage
    *   First two quarters should be planned at higher granularity for tracking progress
    *   1 week granularity for first 2 months of Phase 2
    *   Will to check with stakeholders on acceptable level of granularity before end of quarter
### **Key Technical Decisions**
*   Closed loop control currently scoped as upgradeable capability
    *   System architecture will support adding sensors and control – deliverable of Phase 1 will be product development roadmap which includes milestones for when we need to decide on incorporation of this feature and others (such as multi-color)
    *   Need certainty timeline for these features: e.g. 50% by end of Q1, 75% by end of Q3
*   Similar approach for other features (different LED colors, wavelengths)
    *   Design for future expansion rather than immediate implementation
    *   Important to know all relevant timelines that pertain to each of these features: biology, hardware, business case development
### **Strategic Alignment Discussion**
*   Need session with bio team on roadmap alignment
    *   What are first product use cases requiring multicolor control
    *   Timeline for when different capabilities needed
    *   Current hypothesis unclear on first product offering
*   Milestones for key decisions:
    *   When we need to know when things are ready (closed-loop control, multiple colors, specific wavelengths)
    *   What does it take to develop hardware/software technology for each scenario
    *   What does it take to develop biology for each scenario
    *   Understanding customer requirements for each capability
*   Vidar to add context/nuance on why Q3 2027 for GMP Illuminator to tech roadmap
*   Vidar to lead whiteboard session with bio team on roadmap (after Lonza visit)
*   Important to have GMP illuminator on roadmap even without immediate GMP run
    *   Gives customers confidence for onboarding cell line development projects in Q1
    *   Customers need to see plan and delivery confidence
### **Next Steps**
*   Will to send follow-up message after reviewing notes
*   Monthly steering committee meetings for project duration
    *   Next meeting in December
    *   January meeting
    *   Review all deliverables in early February
*   Will to clarify different types of milestones expected in draft plan:
    *   Delivery milestones
    *   Feasibility study conclusions
    *   Decision points
    *   Hiring/expertise acquisition
* * *

# 2025-11-10 Requirements Review + Downselection

# **GMP Illuminator Requirements Review + Downselection**
Mon, 10 Nov 25 · [c\_1886bkqp25l48gc9mohbsoag264k0@resource.calendar.google.com](mailto:c_1886bkqp25l48gc9mohbsoag264k0@resource.calendar.google.com), [max@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max@prolific-machines.com), [madeleine@prolific-machines.com](mailto:madeleine@prolific-machines.com)
### **System Architecture Definition**
*   Agreed on 4 main subsystems for modular illuminator (attached)
    [GMP Illuminator Architecture - Draft 1 - Draft 2.pdf](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/01b3d4cd-513a-4610-bdaa-b6ff2910d2a4/GMP%20Illuminator%20Architecture%20-%20Draft%201%20-%20Draft%202.pdf)
    *   Controller subsystem: user interface, environment management (enclosure), electronics, firmware
    *   Power subsystem: may be separate from controller depending on requirements
    *   Illuminator subsystem: light sources, environment management (enclosure)
    *   Sensing subsystem: separate from illuminator
    *   Software management subsystem: backend (data) and frontend (UI)
*   Architecture enables clear ownership assignment to team members
    *   Baxter: illuminator subsystem (starting January)
    *   Ryan: controller subsystem after Blastoise completion
    *   Taylor: sensors and optical simulation work
### **Requirements Prioritization Framework**
*   Three critical focus areas identified - in order to learn about requirements with major timeline implications ASAP - this will help us to identify the big chunks of time in our technology roadmap.
    *   **User requirements**: human interaction, CDMO validation processes, installation needs, reliability specs
    *   **GMP compliance:** 21 CFR standards, audit infrastructure, testing protocols
    *   **Opto requirements:** "what questions do we need to answer to build the illuminator? What do we need to know now vs. later? What is the impact on timelines of changing opto specs? What subsystems are the opto specs related to?"
![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/9da85000-3edc-4f86-a276-6b29702234ad/IMG_7652.jpg)
*   Timeline-critical requirements take priority over implementation details
*   James (Mytos) advised: don’t over-engineer for GMP compliance in prototypes
    *   Focus on building functional device first
    *   Add GMP compliance iteratively
    *   Self-reporting model in US reduces certification burden
### **GMP Compliance Strategy**
*   Senior mechanical engineer should own GMP specifications (Baxter role)
*   Key unknowns requiring external consultation
    *   IQ/OQ/PQ qualification processes and timelines
    *   Data storage and audit trail requirements
    *   Validation methodology for customer onboarding
*   Lonza meeting Friday: opportunity to understand CDMO validation expectations
*   User Requirement Specification (URS) format research needed for industry standards
### **Optical Specifications Coordination**
*   Max and Taylor to engage opto team on critical design parameters
    *   Reversion kinetics (currently ~30 minutes acceptable range)
    *   Sensitivity requirements (expect similar or better than current systems)
    *   Multiplexing and wavelength requirements timing
*   Need two-way conversation before opto team finalizes selections
*   Modular design provides flexibility for range of specifications
### **External Consultation Plan**
*   Budget: couple thousand dollars available for consultant hours
*   Consult Pete and Alex first for recommendations and free initial guidance
*   Focus areas for paid consultation
    *   GMP regulatory compliance timeline implications
    *   User requirement specification development
    *   Industry standard validation processes
*   Prepare draft materials before engaging consultants for maximum value
### **Resource Allocation and Timeline**
*   January target for work stream assignments
    *   Baxter freed up after Palkia installations
    *   Ryan available after Blastoise completion
    *   Taylor’s CFD simulation workload TBD
*   Requirements mapping to subsystems needed before team handoff
*   Prototype development parallel to requirements gathering
    *   Don’t wait for complete specifications
    *   Focus on modular patch-style approach (lowest regulatory risk)
### **Action Items**
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) : share architecture diagram and subsystem buckets with team
*   All: map assigned requirements into defined subsystems
*   **User requirements:** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) (with support from [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) )

### Questions:
*   What category of GMP does this device fall under? (medical device or other?)
*   Which regulations may apply to our device ? Any specifics for the illumination subsystem?
    *   we have identified the 21 CFR 11 and 211 requirements for electronics and data but there could be other things we don't yet know.
*   when is the best time to engage regulatory experts in these specific domains
*   How does equipment like an illuminator fit into the overall qualification process for a GMP facility? (it will impact the process, but not be process-contacting)
    *   Does equipment actually need to have a specific certification? Or just be qualified to do what it's supposed to do?

Advice category
*   where do first-time teams usually get wrong about the compliance element of development?

# Conversation notes
*   brief intro to eric about our tech
*   asking: how does a device like this fit into the regulatory / qualification process?
*   where does this fit in? TOX?
    *   we would move through the prcoess with the asset owner
*   start with preclinical, hoping to grow with the client through scale up / clinical trials
    *   in general: stirngency on gmp goes up as you go toward commercialization
    *   design with the end in mind
    *   plan for full gmp adherence = considerable
    *   can implement this in a phased manner over time.
    *   pre-clinical: everyone would ask for them, but a light lift compared to phase 3 etc
    *   considerations on the device apparatus + control modules,
    *   much more expensive to retrofit a system than to build with latent capabilities
    *   GMP = compliance documents. How strictly did we document everything about this material, process , machine... how strictly can we prove to someone else
    *   at least initially: fine to do phased implementation of "GMPs"
    *   certain aspects of device = not subject to GMP, just maintenance
*   cGMPs = practices plural
    *   gmp compliant vs GMPs

eric did scenario planning on different capital structuers
*   is the partner already GMP compliant? and to what extent?
    *   partner has already produced a molecule in a GMP fashion, and is either redoing the process with us to achieve performance, or doing the next molecule / integrating into their plant
    *   are they already FDA inspection? yes, sems like the most likely scenario vs a new startup cdmo
*   implement Prolific Quality Management System itno customer quality management system
    *   "ways of working" making sure you + your client "mean the same things in your documentaiton"
*   thinking about illuminator system for clinical
    *   finish+fill on site ? or is it contracted out ?
    *   what kind of testing will we be doing in a preclinical phase in terms of quality (measuring safety + efficacy)
*   clarification: existing CDMO running operations. we install their sytem (bioreactor accesory)- they run the process with this add on accessory illumination system. switch over to the next client and we pull stuff off
    *   physically remove the device
*   with using SUBs - most important thing is the PQs (and other Qs) and qualifying so you meet minimum performance specifications for the system. Plus extremely well written SOPs so that customers can run without you

example: SOP we checked that the light is loaded into the computer and it completes.
*   later: we check every 15 minutes that each LED is iluminating and the illumination level is consistent etc

equipment itself is not a GMP piece of equipment... but faiclity / process gets the gmp qualification. we ned to be set up properly to meet those standards
*   Nothing is GMP. everything is qualified to be GMP
*   GMP = Documentation level, to prove you know what you know to someone who doesn't know what you know
*   for non-gmp, you dont have to prove to other people what that means. you will qualify as GMP / subject to GMP
*   materials: certain alloys cannot be used because of corrosion / leaching
*   certain plastics . etc. those materials are essentially GMP because they have been vetted
*   all the operation / cleaning / stuff is set by us .

FDA emerging technology review happening in parallel
*   unique-to-this-system aspects of GMP qualification
*   before eric left prolific, he applied to emerging technology program = general applicability
*   priority, free review + FDA expertise, can take a bunch of meetings etc; but you have to get accepted
*   now we have access to all of these resources, predominantly \_\_\_\_
*   we are proposing how these things are subjected to GMPs
*   Vidar is running point on the Prolific side of things . generating documents and dossiers
*   got accepted 6-7 months ago . has been working with Vidar + team to start first meeting
    *   first meeting feedback will be very helpful
    *   somewhere in jan / feb to have this meeting with the fda
*   Vidar can share the application
*   what resources would you use for this?
    *   GFIs (guidance for industry) on different stages - based on the regulations, but easier to understand and digest
        *   Preclinical
        *   Good manufacturing guidance (FDA)
    *   Quality Management & Regulatory Teams of the target CDMO
        *   concern about level of development?
        *   you have to go in with a plan baked. you want them to review a plan rather than make one up , it would spook them if you dont have a plan.
            *   build up a dossier and set of documents for them to review - we need to decide (maybe via sequoia consulting)
                *   qualification program
                    *   validation data -→ Clarify with Eric what this means?
                *   SOPs
                *   ideally a point of contact who can speak their language (Alex for example, who can translate)

come up with a strategy for when we engage with lonza. what are the steps we need to take to be ready to start discussions with them?
*   Guiding question when deciding things such as which SOPs are ready: what needs to be done repeatably for the product to be produced without any issues?

## Will's Notes
# **Regulatory support for bioreactor design**
Wed, 26 Nov 25 · [eric.schulze@prolific-machines.com](mailto:eric.schulze@prolific-machines.com), [madeleine@prolific-machines.com](mailto:madeleine@prolific-machines.com), JellyBelly-1-Strawberry Jam (6)
### **GMP Regulatory Framework for Illuminator System**
*   GMP stringency increases as you get closer to commercialization
*   Need to plan for full GMP adherence from the start
    *   Can implement these in a phased manner over time
    *   Pre-clinical: GMP isn’t required, very light lift at this stage
    *   Much more expensive to retrofit than build early with latent capabilities
    *   GMPs are compliance documents - proving you know what you know to someone else
*   “Nothing is GMP - everything is qualified to be GMP”
    *   Documentation level determines compliance
    *   Equipment gets qualified for GMP use, not inherently GMP
### **Integration with CDMO Partners**
*   How to integrate Prolific Quality Management System into client QMS
    *   Must mean same things in documentation across organizations
    *   Partner scenarios: existing GMP-compliant CDMOs already FDA inspected
*   George previously did scenario planning around buy/build/partner capital structures
*   Hardest challenge: designing system for full commercial scale
*   Most important elements for our device:
    *   Performance qualifications (PQs) to meet standards and specs
    *   Well-documented SOPs so clients can run process without our intervention
*   Material considerations: certain alloys/plastics restricted due to corrosion/leaching risks
### **FDA Emerging Technology Program**
*   Prolific accepted 6-7 months ago into FDA program
*   Benefits: free priority review, access to full FDA expertise collective
*   Technology must have general/universal applicability
*   We get to propose how illuminator systems are regulated and subject to GMPs
*   Vidar running point from Prolific side, Eric from FDA side
*   First meeting targeted for January/February 2026
    *   Feedback will provide critical direction on unique-to-illuminator GMP requirements
    *   May include representatives from this hardware project
*   Vidar can share the accepted application (5-page document)
### **Regulatory Resources and Engagement Strategy**
*   Consult Guidance for Industries (GFIs) - don’t bother with raw regulations
    *   GFIs translate regulations into actionable guidance
    *   Focus on: good manufacturing guidance, pre-clinical guidance
*   Client engagement timing: need comprehensive plan before approaching CDMO regulatory teams
    *   Want them to react to our plan rather than design it
    *   Would spook partners if approached too early without preparedness
*   Required documentation before CDMO engagement:
    *   Qualification program with validation data
    *   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
    *   Point of contact who speaks quality language (like Alex)
*   Work with Sequoia QMS consultants to draft readiness dossier
### **SOP Development Requirements**
*   Example progression from pre-clinical to Phase 3:
    *   Pre-clinical: “Check light patterning program loads and completes”
    *   Phase 3: “Check every 15 minutes that each LED illuminates at proper luminance levels with documentation”
*   Key SOPs needed for repeatable production without quality issues:
    *   Installation procedures
    *   Testing protocols
    *   Maintenance procedures
    *   Calibration processes
### **Next Steps Strategy**
*   Develop strategy for Lonza engagement timeline
*   Define steps needed before initiating CDMO discussions
*   Coordinate with Vidar on FDA Emerging Technology Program integration
*   Align hardware development with overall regulatory roadmap
* * *

### **GMP Regulatory Framework for Illuminator System**
*   GMP stringency increases as you get closer to commercialization
*   Need to plan for full GMP adherence from the start
    *   Can implement these in a phased manner over time
    *   Pre-clinical: GMP isn’t required, very light lift at this stage
    *   Much more expensive to retrofit than build early with latent capabilities
    *   GMPs are compliance documents - proving you know what you know to someone else
*   “Nothing is GMP - everything is qualified to be GMP”
    *   Documentation level determines compliance
    *   Equipment gets qualified for GMP use, not inherently GMP
### **Integration with CDMO Partners**
*   How to integrate Prolific Quality Management System into client QMS
    *   Must mean same things in documentation across organizations
    *   Partner scenarios: existing GMP-compliant CDMOs already FDA inspected
*   George previously did scenario planning around buy/build/partner capital structures
*   Hardest challenge: designing system for full commercial scale
*   Most important elements for our device:
    *   Performance qualifications (PQs) to meet standards and specs
    *   Well-documented SOPs so clients can run process without our intervention
*   Material considerations: certain alloys/plastics restricted due to corrosion/leaching risks
### **FDA Emerging Technology Program**
*   Prolific accepted 6-7 months ago into FDA program
*   Benefits: free priority review, access to full FDA expertise collective
*   Technology must have general/universal applicability
*   We get to propose how illuminator systems are regulated and subject to GMPs
*   Vidar running point from Prolific side, Eric from FDA side
*   First meeting targeted for January/February 2026
    *   Feedback will provide critical direction on unique-to-illuminator GMP requirements
    *   May include representatives from this hardware project
*   Vidar can share the accepted application (5-page document)
### **Regulatory Resources and Engagement Strategy**
*   Consult Guidance for Industries (GFIs) - don’t bother with raw regulations
    *   GFIs translate regulations into actionable guidance
    *   Focus on: good manufacturing guidance, pre-clinical guidance
*   Client engagement timing: need comprehensive plan before approaching CDMO regulatory teams
    *   Want them to react to our plan rather than design it
    *   Would spook partners if approached too early without preparedness
*   Required documentation before CDMO engagement:
    *   Qualification program with validation data
    *   Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
    *   Point of contact who speaks quality language (like Alex)
*   Work with Sequoia QMS consultants to draft readiness dossier
### **SOP Development Requirements**
*   Example progression from pre-clinical to Phase 3:
    *   Pre-clinical: “Check light patterning program loads and completes”
    *   Phase 3: “Check every 15 minutes that each LED illuminates at proper luminance levels with documentation”
*   Key SOPs needed for repeatable production without quality issues:
    *   Installation procedures
    *   Testing protocols
    *   Maintenance procedures
    *   Calibration processes
### **Next Steps Strategy**
*   Develop strategy for Lonza engagement timeline
*   Define steps needed before initiating CDMO discussions
*   Coordinate with Vidar on FDA Emerging Technology Program integration
*   Align hardware development with overall regulatory roadmap
* * *

# 2025-12-05 Check-in: FDA ETP Program and Lonza Engagement Strategy

Attendees: [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) (joined late)

# Description
Meeting to discuss:
1. How can we involve the GMP Illuminator in the FDA Emerging Tech Program so we can get early feedback? 
    1. Vidar - Would love to understand if the illuminator is out of scope for this program, because Mads and I just learned about it from Eric last week.
2. What steps do we need to take to engage Lonza to get early feedback from them on our hardware system while presenting a clear, confidence-building plan for a compliant, working system.
    1. Max - what are the next steps for working with them? Any ongoing conversations related to scheduling a site visit that we should be aware of?
    2. Vidar - what are some of the risks you see with getting feedback from them on our designs, and how can we mitigate those?
# Notes
1. FDA ETP: background
    1. a way to interface with FDA before submitting IND/BLA
    2. putting together a doc focused on process that will be shared with them
        1. can be ok to add hardware to that
        2. we can include a list of specifications in narrative form
        3. vidar will share current prep doc

2\. Lonza is a slow moving, cautious, etc company. So we want to avoid distracting them early on
*   BMGF = good place to source consultants who would review our assets before Lonza, who can help represent the likely needs / perspectives
*   Sensitivities from Lonza regarding our relationship
*   ongoing discussions
    1. \- what is required to build a partnership
    2. how can we incorporate altrubio partnership with Lonza?
        1. also separate discussions with altrubio
1. lonza contacts - they can bring us to Bend facility (only 50L R&D facility)
2. lonza typically moves very slow / highly regulated
3. they want to prevent us talking to other teams too early - derail partnership
4. Vidar is open to share info in early states - but only if it services the partnership
5. visit to Bend is a good first step
    1. Ask Brandon and Christian: who can review these requirements who is a safe sparring partner
*   someone on operations from Lonza should be on focus team with altrubio to talk about equipment specs

# Next Steps
1. [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) **:** schedule lonza site visit - bend
    1. delegation: vidar, max hu, mads, will, pete/alex, opto (?)…
        1. after that, decide whether we can get a partner within Lonza to give us feedback
    2. **decide later:** can we bring a high-level design for them to respond to?
2. [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) to ask his new point of contact from BMGF for regulatory/gmp consultant or partner
3. [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) get early feedback from a non-lonza CDMO / quality contact on our specs
    1. only share specs once they have been reviewed and look like something they would expect from an established equipment vendor
4. [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to share any updates re: three-way discussions with Lonza and Altru
5. [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to share updates from ETP meeting - add Will/Mads to channel if possible

## Agenda (45 min):
*   Biology resourcing for scale-up experiments (enabling GMP Illuminator design lock) - [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245), 10 min
    *   [2025-2026 Bio Resourcing Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1L_U4V1dApz7pTbL1-YCZsEiOK21gMZ68tJPumqNMw/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=107219103470409924072) - this is currently listed as priority #9
    *   hard to estimate resourcing before knowing what questions need to be answered → which experiments need to be run
    *   once cell line is selected, that enables experimentation to be done
        *   lots of this experimentation should be done by process development team
    *   can learn a lot about many cell lines at small scales → define envelope of opto specifications
    *   opto team is already doing experimentation about opto chassis lines to inform scale-up
    *   Taylor is currently drafting a list of questions for opto team
        *   Opto team can share information on what they currently collect - what is the delta between what the HW team needs?
        *   [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) to provide input on priority
        *   [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to provide input on products that this will support
    *   What kinds of products do we need to support with this illuminator?
        *   most likely: GA, Raspberry mAbs
    *   [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to validate whether cells need to be protected from ambient light for first product / when we need to make a decision
    *   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) to assess feasibility of culturing cells under ambient light in seed train
        *   e.g. do we need a chemical repressor or do we need to run experiments to test whether light-sensitive cells can be cultured under ambient light then put into a light-induced process?
    *   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) to launch a scale-up working group / program:
        *   We're missing a cohesive group, ownership & accountability for process scale-up (overall product, process - incl. cells & hardware). Should a working group or program be set up to own this?
*   Overview of current design ideas - [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042), 10 min
    *   
*   Review proposed milestones (see below for cross-functional milestones) - [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065), 10 min
*   Biology roadmap update - [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) & [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042), 5 min
    *   Biology roadmap to be developed in January

# **GMP Illuminator Steering Committee**
Mon, 08 Dec 25 · [c\_1885rna4eud5ogq4milutho5cqiso@resource.calendar.google.com](mailto:c_1885rna4eud5ogq4milutho5cqiso@resource.calendar.google.com), [max@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max@prolific-machines.com), [max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com), [victor@prolific-machines.com](mailto:victor@prolific-machines.com), [madeleine@prolific-machines.com](mailto:madeleine@prolific-machines.com), [vidar@prolific-machines.com](mailto:vidar@prolific-machines.com), [alex.toda@prolific-machines.com](mailto:alex.toda@prolific-machines.com)
### **Context**
The GMP Illuminator Steering Committee met to address critical decisions and coordination needs for the GMP Illuminator project development. The session focused on three key areas: biology resourcing requirements for scale-up experiments that will inform illuminator design specifications, current hardware design concepts, and milestone planning across functional areas. The meeting also aimed to align biology roadmap development with hardware timelines for the first commercial product.
### **Notes**
### **Biology Resourcing for Scale-Up Experiments**
*   Currently listed as priority #9 out of 19 high-priority items in the 2025-2026 Bio Resourcing Tool
*   Resourcing estimates difficult without knowing specific experimental requirements
    *   Taylor is drafting questions for the opto team to determine what experiments need to be run
    *   Once cell line is selected, this will enable targeted experimentation
    *   Much of the experimentation may be handled by the process development team rather than opto team
*   Opto team already collecting relevant data on chassis lines for scale-up decisions
    *   Light sensitivity measurements, dark reversion kinetics, temperature sensitivity
    *   Leakiness characteristics at different temperatures
    *   Can learn significant information at small scales (96-well) without requiring large-scale experiments
*   Key specification questions need business input rather than just technical measurements
    *   Which products the illuminator must support (likely Green Apple and Raspberry mAbs)
    *   Level of light control precision required
    *   Whether multiple colors need simultaneous support
    *   Acceptable leakiness levels from background light
### **Ambient Light Protection Requirements**
*   Critical decision needed: whether cells require protection from ambient light during culture
    *   Impacts both illuminator design complexity and facility requirements
    *   Room light repression not feasible on current timeline for implementation
    *   Cryptochrome-based systems with tetracycline might provide solution
    *   Local interventions (foil covering reactors) may be sufficient for 50L and larger reactors
*   Different requirements across reactor sizes
    *   50L glass reactors can be easily covered
    *   Larger reactors already mostly enclosed with jacketing
    *   Sub-scale reactors present fewer challenges for light shielding
### **Current Illuminator Design Concepts**
*   Three design concepts under development, two similar enough for single invention disclosure filing
*   Slab design: Modular hexagonal units in protective casing mounted to reactor side
    *   Magnetic attachment not viable for most bioreactors
    *   Requires mounting system for even surface protection
*   Rod design: Modular units with LED rods extending from top mount
    *   Potentially flatter profile, easier top mounting
    *   Similar control architecture to slab design
*   Light guide design: LEDs positioned remotely with light guide distribution
    *   Flattest possible profile
    *   Taylor (optics expert) concerned about light intensity limitations
    *   More difficult height adjustment and mounting
    *   Potential advantage for blackout applications
*   All designs share common system architecture, light sources, and sensor integration
*   Universal compatibility prioritized over reactor-specific optimization
    *   Walls provide more consistent mounting surfaces than tops/bottoms
    *   Bag modifications explicitly avoided due to regulatory complexity
### **Cross-Functional Milestone Categories**
*   Decision milestones: Opto system selection, color requirements, control precision needs
*   Product development: Customer specification acceptance at key stages
*   Resources and expertise: Some roles scoped (top three), others requiring decisions on hiring vs. external support
*   User/customer requirements: Dependent on product and commercial team input
*   Feasibility studies: Optical validation throughout development process
*   Qualification: Alpha/beta testing with opto and bioprocess development support
### **Biology Roadmap Development Status**
*   Biology roadmap development delayed, likely starting early 2026
*   Most critical element: timeline for cell lines intended for first commercial product
    *   Green Apple and Raspberry mAb cell lines most likely candidates
    *   Current Green Apple line may need re-engineering
    *   FTO discussion has been accelerated and reprioritized
    *   Three cell lines discussed as primary candidates with potential for higher dark requirements
### **Scale-Up Coordination Gaps**
*   No cohesive group currently owns overall scale-up strategy connecting product, cell line development, process development, and hardware
*   Example communication failure: temperature shift from 37°C to 34°C development impacted illuminator specifications
*   Need for regular communication of seemingly minor technical changes that could affect hardware specifications
*   Expensive hardware corrections make specification accuracy critical
### **Key Takeaways**
*   Biology resourcing for GMP Illuminator scale-up experiments requires approximately one person’s effort, with exact scope dependent on business decisions about product support requirements
*   Three viable illuminator design concepts identified, with slab and rod designs preferred over light guide due to intensity concerns
*   Critical decision point needed on ambient light protection requirements, as this significantly impacts both hardware design complexity and facility modification needs
*   Missing coordination structure for scale-up activities across cell line development, process engineering, and hardware teams creates communication and specification alignment risks
### **Risks Flagged**
*   **Specification Lock-In Risk**: Limited biology resourcing may force narrow specifications that only support first customer, potentially requiring costly redesign for future applications
*   **Timeline Misalignment**: Biology roadmap development delayed until early 2026 while hardware development needs cell line specifications for design decisions
*   **Communication Gaps**: Lack of systematic information sharing between biology and hardware teams has already caused specification mismatches (temperature requirements)
*   **Regulatory Complexity**: Any modifications to bioreactor bags would create significant regulatory hurdles and slow implementation timelines
*   **Light Guide Intensity Limitations**: Taylor’s concerns about achieving required light intensities through light guide design may eliminate this option despite space advantages
### **Decisions & Action Items**
**Decisions Made:**
*   Provisionally allocate approximately one person’s biology resourcing for GMP Illuminator scale-up experiments, with monthly reassessment capability
*   Avoid any bioreactor bag modifications due to regulatory complexity
**Action Items:**
1. **Vidar van der Meijden**: Validate whether cells need protection from ambient light for first product and establish timeline for this decision
2. **Victor Jones**: Assess feasibility of culturing cells under ambient light in seed train, including evaluation of chemical repressor needs and light-sensitivity experiments
3. **Max Hoerner**: Provide input on prioritization for Taylor’s experimental question list to help scope biology resourcing requirements
4. **Alex Toda**: Establish scale-up working group to own coordination between cell line development, process development, and hardware teams
5. **Will Paton**: Participate in scale-up working group establishment
6. **Vidar van der Meijden**: Own roadmap development for cell lines that could be used for first GMP batch (Green Apple, Raspberry mAbs)
7. **Will Paton**: Schedule workshop later this week to combine Taylor’s experimental questions with business priority input for resourcing decisions
8. **Will Paton and Madeleine Allen**: Circulate detailed roadmap before January meeting for review and feedback

    *   more common for integrated suites
    *   vendors: emerson, honeywell, schneider
    *   usually cloud or local server
*   PLC: programmable logic conroller
    *   similar architecture to DCS
    *   typically point-of-use, attached to utility skids
    *   can also be on a bioreactor. less overhead on PLC vs DCS
    *   most common: Rockwell, Siemens

# Granola Notes
### Control System Architecture Overview
*   Two main types: DCS (Distributed Control System) vs PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)
    *   DCS: Integrated manufacturing suites, vendors like Emerson/Honeywell
        *   Better for multiple bioreactors (7+ reactors typical)
        *   More integrated software layers from ground up
        *   Uses Sequential Function Charts (SFC) for batch control
    *   PLC: Point-of-use systems, Rockwell/Siemens dominant
        *   Individual skids (TFF, chromatography, single bioreactor)
        *   Separate applications, more overhead to integrate
        *   Ladder logic programming, faster I/O (microsecond level)
*   Both provide end-to-end solutions from control processors down to I/O cards
*   All major vendors use standardized protocols (Ethernet IP, Profibus, Foundation Fieldbus)
### Integration Strategy for Prolific Systems
*   Recommended approach: Start standalone, avoid early integration complexity
    *   Local installation like ATF systems initially
    *   Operator manually controls when to start/stop illumination
    *   Only requires SOP documentation, maximum flexibility
*   Integration pathway via OPC UA protocol
    *   Software-based, runs over Ethernet (not hardware bus protocols)
    *   Bi-directional communication standard across all modern systems
    *   Interfaces at program hub level, not control processor level
*   Customer expectations: Reliable vendors, UL-rated electrical panels, standard components
    *   Don’t need same hardware architecture as major automation vendors
    *   Focus on functionality and standard performance criteria
### Data Management & Compliance
*   Two compliant data collection options:
    1. Local data storage with validation requirements
        *   Must quantify storage duration, format, extraction methods
    2. External data lake connection (preferred modern approach)
        *   API to PI historian or cloud data lake
        *   Bypasses local historian complexity
*   Internet connectivity generally acceptable in modern GMP facilities
    *   Must pass cybersecurity validation process
    *   Ethernet drops typically available, avoid USB connections
*   Remote troubleshooting capability seen as advantage vs. liability
### Technical Implementation Considerations
*   OPC UA implementation: Software-only, no special hardware ICs needed
    *   Existing OPC server experience with capacitance probes applicable
    *   RJ45 ethernet connection to microcontroller sufficient
*   Control logic decisions:
    *   Expose controller with state machine directly vs. separate computer for OPC UA
    *   Need start/stop/hold commands from master controller
    *   Consider fault recovery states (resume vs. restart illumination)
*   Safety systems remain external electrical interlocks, not software-based
### Next Steps
*   Ryan to define system architecture, then reverse presentation for Alex’s feedback
*   Consider low-hanging fruit OPC UA implementation with Sartorius bioreactor
*   Evaluate what data formats match regulatory expectations
*   Engage validation company for software validation package when ready
*   Focus on maintenance-friendly electrical panel design with logical arrangement

# Notes during overview
*   S95
*   ERP (SAP)
    *   "we used x media, y reagent, single use assemblies, etc" → Cost tracking
*   MES
*   Level 1 = Control system layer
    *   2 distinct types with a lot of overlap but have distinct architecture

## Level 1 - A
PCS/DCS distributed
*   more common for integrated suites
*   DCS = integrated
*   more overhead
*   Software
    *   SFC = sequencial function chart (text based graphhical system admin)
*   HMI/Scada = more efficient here
*   Control processor (self contained unit) - interface with io layer and run control logic
    *   all firmware at this level, driven by software
    *   IO Layer
        *   analog inputs / outputs
        *   IO Cards
        *   can be digital too
        *   probes or devices communication
        *   

## Level 1 - B
PLCs
*   Utility / CIP skids . TFF chromotography skid or bioreactor
*   Rockwell = most common. Siemans also common.
*   Software
    *   Can still be text based but more common = ladder logic
    *   very fast io layers
*   HMI / Scada = still inefficient here
*   IO

Fieldbus protocol
*   ethernet/IP (both)
*   profibus (DCS)
*   modbus (both)
*   foundation fieldbus (DCS)

OPC UA
*   object oriented process control unified architecure
    *   protocol to pass data between systems
    *   both systems typically use this
    *   bidirectional
        *   connect to other data sources (reading probe info etc)
*   Program Hub
    *   IPV4 / IPV6
    *   Server level identification
    *   direct data to the program hub or historian
    *   batch manager / control loop
    *   passes data
    *   requires programming on "both sides"
        *   Unit ID, state, assignable,
        *   write into the control block to translate data
*   probably will use OPC UA for the CLC if we do that

We would have to work with CDMO or vendor partner to provide a standard interface. Working with single use vendors (sartorius, thermo etc). "can you provide a standard protocol interface"
*   Optogenetic software only interface

do we need to integrate with a historian of the device? or can we have our own historian?
*   options: local data collection or API
*   local
    *   some portion of hard drive, has to pass validation (how much data, what form, how long, extraction protocol)
*   API (data protocol connection, not an external device like a USB)
    *   PI integration: push data into the data lake
    *   bypasses the historian level and sends data one level higher (level 2 instead of level 1)

have our own internet connection?
*   need to decide where to come in:
    *   Corporate or manufacturing net
    *   ethernet hub of some type / ethernet drops available
        *   hub = more admin / overhead

how smart are program hubs?
*   exposed data layer
*   sequential / real time functions
    *   PID 1st and 2nd order equations for pH control

BAS (building automation system)
*   temp humidity gasses door open / close
*   incubator and freezer farms plugged into BAS
*   could hook up to DCS, typically with restricted information passed between them

is illuminator system expected to have one of the 2 architectures and specific vendors? how do we meet their expectaions?
*   not expected to have same hardware architecture of the vendors
*   UL rating, use reliable vendors, are they known, etc
*   same goes for the software

# James Cunningham - Mytos

Hello team! Here’s a summary with **key recommendations from my conversation with** [**James Cunningham**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-cunningham-508b8480/) ([Mytos](https://www.mytos.bio/)) this morning.
**Topic:** Lessons from Mytos’s path to GMP-ready hardware and scaling customer-facing systems
**1\. Control & Reliability**
*   Design hardware for **consistent, repeatable installs** and minimal user error.
*   Expect wide variation in user competence — make systems robust to misuse.
*   **Test aggressively in-house** and deploy early units in real environments to uncover unpredictable failure modes.
*   Instrument for sensing and failure tracking; learn fast before scale-up.
**2\. Parallel GMP & Learning**
*   **Don’t wait for GMP** to start learning from customers.
*   Push early, research-use units into customer hands to gather feedback before compliance slows iteration.
*   Once under GMP, every change requires validation — learn while you can still move fast.
**3\. Focus & Prioritization**
*   **Hyperfocus resources** on the few systems critical for customer delivery and proof at scale (e.g., GMP bag illuminator).
*   De-prioritize internal-only devices and nonessential development work.
*   Concentration enables faster iteration, clearer ownership, and team alignment.
**4\. Team & Structure**
*   Build a balance between **development** and **operations**:
    *   Engineers focus on design and improvement.
    *   Technicians handle assembly, installs, and first-line troubleshooting.
*   Add targeted senior hires (e.g., **staff mechanical engineer**, **lightweight quality/compliance support**, later **software dev**).
*   Keep production in-house until volumes justify outsourcing — gives control and flexibility.
**5\. GMP & Regulatory Strategy**
*   Start with a **User Requirement Specification (URS)** co-written with a first customer — this defines your compliance scope.
*   Focus on three pillars:
    1. **Company posture** (e.g., ISO 9001 if valuable, not mandatory)
    2. **Device safety** (start from IEC 61010 or UL/CE equivalents)
    3. **Customer requirements** (GMP expectations from CDMOs)
*   **Stay pragmatic:** avoid over-engineering quality systems or hiring large compliance firms early on.
**6\. Culture**
*   Keep a **high-trust, energetic team** — hire people who energize you.
*   Expect a “figure-it-out” mindset: “We need to be GMP in 9 months? Okay, we’ll get there.”
*   Strong, motivated teams beat process-heavy organizations at this stage.
**Core takeaway:**
> Build reliability and learning loops now, stay focused on the few systems that matter, and grow the team and processes just far enough to support GMP readiness — not beyond what’s needed.

# 12/12/25 Cell Line Latest Info - Notes from Vidar

"""
Notes from our discussion on cell lines & light shielding requirements for manufacturing - adding Kiana, Max Hu, Mon and Emily for info
*   Green apple and Raspberry cell lines are the most likely to reach customer (GMP) manufacturing first
*   Gavpo is less sensitive compared to Cry2, reducing potential impacts from variations in light exposure
*   Light exposure variation would likely induce process variation that could be problematic - we likely need interventions (at least local green light or shielding)during the seed train
*   Blimp 1 would make it very difficult to implement OG - it is highly preferable that our first cell lines do not include a growth inhibiting function
*   Chemical suppression should be an absolute last resort
*   Key concerns:
    *   GMP banking - should happen under safe light to make sure cells are in their most healthy state
    *   Vial thaw - likely needs to be under safe light
    *   Seed train - exposure will need to be managed - interventions will be required and clear SOPs to ensure proper handling (perhaps we need a sensor that highlights light exposure?)
    *   Production reactor - shielding might be necessary based on the need for precise control
*   Actions:
    *   Vidar to share notes (done)
    *   Max, Victor: Schedule biostrategy discussion to review current plans with a focus on scaling
        *   Based on that regroup and define strategy

](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eC6QlwBPmQktNzq_i2yVQMViUf09KwM9CNw7vSvb4Mw/edit?usp=sharing)

Phil's questions for us:
*   Is this a cadillac or an MVP?
*   IP (doesn't need to be patentable it can be a trade secret)
    *   Vendor-protected IP = a blackbox, you don't have the same documentation burden
        *   if its IP then you dont need the whole thing you just need the input and output
            *   then they dont need to validate every line of code
    *   max mentions that the optical sensing is an area where we are considering this
    *   then dont need design spec and \_\_\_\_\_ something else I missed to be separate they can overlap
*   is there a quality management system in house?
    *   will: sort of, light weight in terms of the biology. but in terms of the hardware design we are starting to figure that out.
    *   phil: compliance comes around your quality management, much less than the \_\_\_
        *   you dont need URS, they will write that for you
        *   they will ask: how do I make sure the quality is good? ISO 9001 = you need to have a quality management system around what you're doing, especially software development
            *   maintaining versions / maintaining all of the quality you need to provide
            *   it isn't that difficult and can be done quickly
            *   ex: auditing your vendors/ suppliers, making sure you are getting quality parts
    *   will: is QMS a third party thing or do you do it yourself?
        *   phil: hired a consultant the first time. then he bought the QMS + documents for $600 the 2nd time. but you need someone in house who understands this and maintains / tailors the documents. as you grow, try to achieve the 9001 status. have to establish + use quality management system. you can set up QMS and certified. you need to show that you had failures and how you overcome them, so that is why it takes a while
            *   MVP approach to this and "how you get there"
            *   the quality management system in place = highly important when you are selling things to customers.
*   phil: will you manufacture these in-house?
    *   max: we are currently wondering if this is the right approach. at least for right now, we don't want to manufacture in house. the way we are currently set up. the prototypes for the first version yes will, but not after the first one.
    *   phil: reduces the quality management system a lot. if you dont have it in house, you wont need inspections / audits. but youll need to show that you audit your vendors. it isn't a huge effort at first but if you are anticipating snowball effect -all differnt size of biorectos you will have different models
*   phil: are you familiar with Finess? (thermo bought)
    *   they sell bioreactor controller on delta-V system. they have almost 30 ppl doing nothing but managing and validating software updates.
        *   every software update you makes needs to be revalidated
        *   customer says "if you did this I would be 20 of them, and you say "ok"" - now all of a sudden you have customers driving the features, and you need to manage this with QMS
        *   you need to bring software people in and quality
*   pete: do you want to tell phil about the SMEs we have, max?
    *   max: unsure which parts of manufacturing / servicing = right for us, but we want to be in the best position to do that.
        *   96 wp illums would make 100s to 1000s and then the software would need more validation
    *   max: current team overview
*   phil: looking at specific platform? other than fw and hw building yourself?
    *   max: we are open to it, there are some platforms that we use - ex: cloud enabled controllers, data goes encrypted in and out of cloud, updates are well controlled through that. data lake (ganymede?) we have an underdeveloped software to work with those.
*   phil: what voltage are these? 120V into outlet?
    *   max: most device = single power supply, DC low voltage power (24V, 9V) and data connection (currently separate). fully open to revising that for this particular illuminator
*   phil: you have in-house designers?
    *   max: yes, though on the whole it is a relatively junior team. it would be helpful to know in what domains it is helpful to hire much more experienced people
*   phil: in North AM, you build to UL standards, people will accept it. In europe = needs to be actually certified. modifications after certification = needs to get certified again. stay in NA as long as you can, that is helpful / a little less expensive
*   pete: is there flexibility in UL standards at gmp level?
    *   if you have a UL Stamp, quality people = less stringent. if not, then you need to show more how you maintain the quality. you dont always have to have it. in NA, most companies don't. like ISO 9000, you dont have to have it , but it makes it easier to get through the quality check
    *   on a UL product vs a UL control pannel - there is a difference. but I am assuming there is a unit with a control panel attached to it . if you ul certifiy the system
    *   pete: more so the system itself, if you sell one of your systems to ex: genentech, is UL certification of that system = mandatory? or is it at discretion of end user company?
        *   phil: discretion of end user
*   pete: easier it was mentioned "industsy standard" aka "legacy" controllers. can you offer a couple words of perspective on if people are open to newcomers ? or do you stick to the deltaV/siemens, etc
    *   phil: most people do siemens or rockwell. deltaV is very hard to do. most companies want something tried/ true which will last. cloud applications in a control system are not going to be accepted. its hard to validate.
        *   codassit? codasys?
        *   end users will check "is this a supported platform?" - novonordisk struggled after bringing a non industry standard platform
    *   max: which part do they provide?
        *   phil: hardware level for PLCs
            *   RepIigen ATF is a rockwell system with their own HMI on it.
            *   nobody will let you use opto22 with a \_\_\_\_ on it, not an industry standard
            *   companies automation teams dictate what you have to use if you give them the option. you have to have something that they're willing to accept
        *   max: trying to understand where the servicable components begin and end. some things are not user servicable but need to be built nonetheless
        *   phil: if you have a raspi you can run any protocol on it. are you looking at your own firmware?
            *   max: that is how we envisioned so far. but this shows you how our exposure. we havent considred these systems
    *   phil: where that comes up = what is the turnaround time on fixing / replacing? how hard is it for someone onsite to fix?
        *   automation teams = used to PLCs / DCSs . otherwise it may be a bit of a culture shock, it will require a plan
*   pete: ATF provides contrast. we arent doing IO / controls like a bioreactor system, but from flexibility / amount that our equipment can impact the cell culture process or final quality attributes, a comparison to ATF is similar
    *   phil: you have a bioreactor w/ sensors that are cabled to system with HMI or something else. assuming similar system, with HMI/ cables
        *   max: depends on what we end up sensing. ex: Closed loop control , not part of the MVP. only sensing optical density. either using an SD card or we use an HMI with a scheduler. over time work with their HMI. less integration = less risk exposure. MVP works differently on contorl level compared to next units if that allows us to demonstrate what is needed in required timeframe
        *   phil: standalone approach = easier compared to timing with bioreactor
*   will: one of our goals is to have the system opereate standalone , but probably need interlock
*   phil: what about data integrity?
    *   max: illuminators need reservation system = keeps track of batches / parameters / etc , all logged immutably in way that is easily retrievable. we already have this. if we can leverage aspects that is great. it could become complicated depending on cusomer expectations
    *   phil: pushing a couple signals to them over communication = not that hard.
        *   will: rather than building full system for tracking that
        *   phil: customer will say why do I gotta look at 2 reports for this. but if you could update data every second. then you dont have to worry, you dont have to tie it back to their system or anything else
        *   max: if we know our likely scaling partner, then we can understand their system better

will: pivot to chatting about how to move forward? what makes sense from your perspective?
*   phil: can provide with what you probably will need, then if you want to tell me about what you want me to do we can go from there. you've gotten prototypes, you have down how you want to do it but now youre going to serial #1, I dont know that you need to bring on a ton of people. can help with quality management and GMP docs. leverage AI for that. its not extremely time consuming. can help you put that together. gotta walk down the strategy there.

# GMP Illuminator - Team Notes



# Master Questions List

# Requirements
*   At what stage should we start managing requirements and specs with some sort of change-controlled system? What level of documentation is required for change control?
*   What is the maximum volume fraction that an illuminator that inserts between the frame and reactor frame be? This is basically asking how much cell culture can we displace? How must stress-strain can we impart on the bag do to that displacement and the illuminator geometry? How much heat transfer between the bag and the reactor frame can we inhibit? Etc... Answering this question can disqualify a lot of our design if the answer is, we can't take up any volume.

# Architecture
*   Is "firmware" the right terminology to be using for this type of system? Should we be using other terms to describe the low-level instructions for the system? Will specific brands of PLC (e.g. Allen-Bradley, DeltaV, Siemens) be required?
*   Does the system really need an HMI?

# Regulatory Compliance Questions

### Compliance Requirements
*   System must be GMP-compliant
    *   Any required hand tools must be GMP-suitable, or system must be toolless
    *     
        
*   System must be 21 CFR Part 11 compliant
    *   Audit logs must include firmware version, configuration changes, plan uploads, user actions, time‑synchronized events and error message.
*   System must be cleanroom-friendly
    *   Material selections must not generate particulates or fibers under normal use (cleanroom classification alignment)
*   Firmware, software, and hardware revisions must be tracked and documented.
*   Sensor calibration must be traceable and logged (pre/post) with calibration status exposed in the HMI and records.
*   Record of traceability documentation from vendors, components, subsystems etc.
*   component traceability and subvendor quality systems
*   Change control: Must have a documented process for controlled updates to hardware or software components.
*   Assembly and packaging in clean environment to not introduce contamination into cleanroom
*   Clock/timestamp synchronization (NTP or hardware RTC) must persist through outages to maintain traceability

### GMP Compliance
*   The system must comply with applicable GMP regulations and standards.
*   The system shall require only GMP-suitable hand tools for operation, or the system shall be designed to be toolless.
*   The system shall maintain and provide documentation for the traceability of all vendors, components, and subsystems.
    *   The system must ensure all critical component suppliers follow quality management systems suitable for GMP manufacturing.
*   A change control process for all updates to hardware, firmware or software components shall be documented and implemented.
    *   All firmware, software, and hardware revisions shall be tracked and documented.

### Electronic Records and Audit Trail
*   The system must comply with 21 CFR Part 11 for electronic records and signatures.
    *   The system shall generate audit logs capturing the following: firmware version, configuration changes, plan uploads, user actions, time-synchronized events, and error messages.
    *   The system shall log sensor calibration events, capturing pre- and post-calibration status, and display calibration status in the HMI and associated records.
    *   The system shall maintain clock and timestamp synchronization that persists through outages to ensure record traceability.

### Cleanroom Suitability
*   The system shall be suitable for operation in cleanroom environments.
    *   All system assembly and packaging shall occur in a clean environment to prevent contamination introduction into a cleanroom.
    *   Material certifications and operational protocols shall explicitly prevent introduction of particulates, fibers, or contaminants.
    *   The system’s materials must not generate particulates or fibers under normal use and must align with cleanroom classification requirements.

### Questions:
*   What category of GMP does this device fall under? (medical device or other?)
*   Which regulations may apply to our device ? Any specifics for the illumination subsystem?
    *   we have identified the 21 CFR 11 and 211 requirements for electronics and data but there could be other things we don't yet know.
*   when is the best time to engage regulatory experts in these specific domains

Advice category
*   where do first-time teams usually get wrong about the compliance element of development?
