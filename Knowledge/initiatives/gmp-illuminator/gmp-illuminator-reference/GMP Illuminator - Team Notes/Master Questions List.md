# Requirements
*   At what stage should we start managing requirements and specs with some sort of change-controlled system? What level of documentation is required for change control?
*   What is the maximum volume fraction that an illuminator that inserts between the frame and reactor frame be? This is basically asking how much cell culture can we displace? How must stress-strain can we impart on the bag do to that displacement and the illuminator geometry? How much heat transfer between the bag and the reactor frame can we inhibit? Etc... Answering this question can disqualify a lot of our design if the answer is, we can't take up any volume.

# Architecture
*   Is \"firmware\" the right terminology to be using for this type of system? Should we be using other terms to describe the low-level instructions for the system? Will specific brands of PLC (e.g. Allen-Bradley, DeltaV, Siemens) be required?
*   Does the system really need an HMI?
