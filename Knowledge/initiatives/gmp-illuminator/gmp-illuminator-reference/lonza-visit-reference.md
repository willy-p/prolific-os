# Lonza Visit Reference

## Scope constraints (R&D team only)
- CLD process walkthrough will be high-level; equipment comments OK; detailed operational specs are later-stage.
- Process validation discussion will be general; R&D develops platform data for operating ranges, while GMP validation is done independently for commercial operations.
- GMP equipment evaluation/validation is out of scope for R&D attendees.
- Installation/user requirements: can cover R&D intake, process development, and platform transfer to operations; GMP specifics not covered.

## Other notes
- Lonza suggests dinner Thursday evening before the visit.
- No fundamental unvalidatable issues seen with current illuminator designs.
- Lonza will provide a high-level agenda and timing after scope confirmation.
