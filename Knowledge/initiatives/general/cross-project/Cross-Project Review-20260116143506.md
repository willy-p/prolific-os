# Cross-Project Review



# 2024 06 04

Goal of this meeting:
*   Alignment of priorities across teams - make decisions on competing priorities
*   Alignment on master timeline across Bio, HW, BPD, Data, Analytics
*   Raise and clarify any questions on why, what, who, when
*   Escalation path for conflicting resource needs, priorities, risks, etc.
*   Intention to move to biweekly meetings
*   Be able to have discussions about scenarios while continuing the execution

Key focus areas for the next Month:
*   Board meeting & Coming out of stealth
*   Implement Epic process & meeting structure - [https://lucid.app/lucidchart/00ed806d-78ad-45e7-8125-4da01d664512/edit?invitationId=inv\_8e2259e9-5123-4d50-83ad-7b7e2aecab0f&page=55Gy2oe3Q4zU#](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/00ed806d-78ad-45e7-8125-4da01d664512/edit?viewport_loc=-1224%2C346%2C4840%2C2162%2C55Gy2oe3Q4zU&invitationId=inv_8e2259e9-5123-4d50-83ad-7b7e2aecab0f)
*   Mature and integrate the Hardware & Software plan in our other plans
    *   **Original goal of Solosis:** show & determine how to maintain consistency between scales
    *   **Solosis V2 & ratiometric control POC**
        *   Solosis V1: Produces an mScarlet protein in response to light, but has some challenges (e.g. increased expression when it's cold)
            *   2L in July including Drattini
            *   info on cell density etc.
            *   
        *   Solosis V2: Expresses a fluorescent protein under constitutive promotor, and expresses a different protein under light control + landing pads
            *   Rationale: use the baseline expression to measure a ratio
            *   Likely needs balancing between
        *   Development and clone selection for a Solosis V2 would need to happen between July and August

| Pros: Solosis v2 | Cons: Solosis v2 |

    *   Step 1: Stably integrating lactoferrin in the bovine cells in 2D and 3D
        *   Tensions between Solosis V2 and protein expression in bovine cells in terms of Emily
    *   Step 2: Understanding the material needs & time investment for analytics
        *   Vidar to align with Ian
*   Solosis V2 vs Solosis V1
    *   Solosis V1 would be the most likely cell line to be scaled to 50 and 200L
    *   Solosis V2 might be in 250ml for the Solosis Online

### Risk, Issue, Highlight roundtable
*       *   Alex:
        *   **Risk** Prioritization across multiple cell lines - across teams - [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to align with Emily, Mon
            *   Hardware
        *   **Risk** Cell line availability is being delayed - can't compress
        *   Issue
        *   Highlights
            *   Nistcho and Solosis V1 lines continue to deliver important learnings - encountering the issues early
*       *   Declan:
        *   Risk: Resourcing for model predictive control
        *   Highlight: Close to potentially hiring a great data person
        *   Highlight: Ganymede integration is going really well
*       *   Mads:
        *   Rissue: Move delays has made planning very difficult
            *   Max: Going to bring some of these discussions up in the move committee
        *   Risk: Solosis V2 being in its infancy
            *   People resourcing is going ok - bioreactor availability might be an issue
        *   Highlight: Dratini data channel update-arino
*       *   ![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/54f8389b-e8a1-464a-a64c-d52cfe9cc7bb/image.png)

*       *   Emily:
        *   Risks: Resourcing of Fonterra work
        *   Risks: If KO of MuSCs works, we need to plan for the compliant engineering?
        *   Highlight: One hit for KO on MuSC growing in single cell suspension - data channel? data didn't add up yet
        *   Highlight: We hired a bunch of people with support of Emily and they're starting to increase throughput already
*       *   Ian:
        *   Risk: Move is causing some delays, which flows through into tool installation and method development - high risk because method development timeline is very tight
        *   Risk: Fonterra resourcing
        *   Highlight: Made small method and read out first NistCHO data
        *   Potential Highlight: We may have 2
*       *   Vidar:
        *   Risk: Communication continues to be a challenge at times - needs our continued attention
        *   Highlight: Almost no issues (yet?)
*       *   Max:
        *   Risk: Amount of time between when we will know what to make and when we need to deliver on deals
            *   Hire someone with experience on scaling up hardware - JD being drafted
        *   Risk: Thin spread team on the hardware side - planning for just-in-time delivery and assuming slack from delays from other teams
        *   Issues: No critical issues
        *   Highlight: The decision to buy the Amber will greatly improve the effectiveness of the team
        *   Highlight: Everyone continues to make really great progress
*       *   Bio:
        *   Issue: XP CHO line is not suitable for the stable cell line

        *   Phase 1 (pending on the MOU and likely requiring a payment): Functional assay
        *   Phase 2 : further development, opto control (light effort in detailing out)
        *   **Plan timelines for customer communication to 97% certainty - ensure we have sufficient slack for re-dos, mishaps, optimization that may be required**
            *   Define ownership for signing off on customer communication timeline - [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421)

    *   3rd or.4th wk of September is earliest timing for data
*   Cultivated meat progress
    *   On track
*   Solosis work
    *   V2/Solosis online - Mads
        *   Requirements are clarified
        *   September handoff to BPD based on the "Medium confidence" plan
            *   Is there a scenario where we don't run V2 in 50 or 200L?
                *   Yes, but it's most likely we'd want to run V1
    *   Continuous Sensing/Process analytical technologies - initial rough scoping, working group including Alex and Taylor, with report to Max and Declan
*   Fonterra plan preparation
    *   Summary from strategy alignment - Emily/Vidar
    *   Kicked-off work on the critical path

# 2024 07 12

Fonterra Tech Scoping review:

*   Costing will be an important input to fee setting towards Fonterra, but will not be shared
*   Costing can be delivered later, as we will first discuss technical scope before we discuss cost
*   Action: Decision flow based on initial titer selection - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)
*   Action: Add expected titer levels as part of Phase 0 for the customer facing deck - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)
*   Maria: It is customary to have customers pay for host selection
*   Action: Create a higher level plan/flow diagram to give the context the discussion with Fonterra - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)
*   Action: Move everything post 2D data generation to Phase 1 - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)
*   Action: Add clear success metrics - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)
    *   Cell line doubling at X DT
    *   Protein production at > ... pg / cell (?)
    *   Illustration of functional assays (Phase 1)
    *   Performance beyond nature (Phase 2)

*   Suspension adaptation risk
    *   Scenario 1: estimate risk for failure and multiply by delay if we fail
    *   Scenario 2: how much would an additional FTE reduce the risk
    *   600-900k was a rough pricing (~100k a month) estimate for bacterial work
        *   This was for ~ 0.25 FTE(!)

**Notes:**
*   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) to follow-up on what our OG scientific strategy based on input from SAB
*   Declan: Request for decision whether to allocate money in the budget by EOY for Raman spectrometer ($150k+ investment)
*   Max Hu.: highlight we need to decide which scales and embodiments to we want to simulate for illumination (OG embodiments for scale)
    *   [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to align with [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) on timeline for this
Hardware update (Max Hu.)
*   hiring Head of Hardware to help manage the team and hardware technician
*   currently there is not buffer time in deliverables and no bandwidth to address work order requests coming in
    *   request for everyone to add illuminators they might need in the future on work order form
*   Call out that simulations are important and team hasn't had enough bandwidth to focus on this sufficiently
*   Plan to pass along more responsibility to OG team for higher experimental throughput; comes with risk as well
*   Vidar: is it feasible for the small team to maintain a fleet of 9+ different systems? Should we revisit this and adjust number of systems we can support
*   Max: welcome feedback on what illuminators to prioritize and how robust to make them!!
Resources for Fonterra phase 1.1
*   Vidar: either need to reduce scope or add resources
    *   Ian: not possible without extra resources to do bother Fonterra and pharma
    *   very limited on Analytics resources
*   might be appetite to hire if we really see the need
*   Action: do internal work to figure out analytics resourcing across projects ( [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)/ [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) to coordinate follow-up meeting on this)
    *   input: technical team to review asks they've shared with analytics and revise as needed
Resource request 09/09-13 for suspension culture with Nessa
*   Could someone from BPD or SynBio help out during this time?
*   Possibly Brandon could help?
*   [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) to connect with Nessa about this

**Actions:**

# 2024 08 22 - Offline alignment on resource needs

*   Leakiness

John:
*   Two concerns:
    *   Lack of inhouse expertise on in-house biochemistry for protein science
    *   Lack of inhouse expertise on high-titer CHO (or other) cell analysis
        *   Concern: how do we have
    *   Hiring between depth and interface
*   Interface between analytical chemistry and biology - how do the products behave in the more crude stages of analysis
    *   Should they be housed in analytics or biology?

Nessa:
*   People come over with questions around: How do we detect protein?
*   Abbvie uses lots of different cell lines - 293 cells was their R&D cell line

Need:
*   An intermediate method for quick and dirty sanity checks
*   Deep knowledge in recombinant protein CHO engineering - someone from a protein science group in pharma

Follow up actions:
*   Draft job description & business case document - [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421)
    *   Involve Nessa, John, Vidar
*   Clarify how the role interfaces with analytics

# 2024 10 01

Notes:
*   Alex: Nov. likely conflict between Humira BPD runs and solosis scale up - will need to make a decision on what to prioritize
    *   check-back in 2 weeks once we have more info on cell line dev progress

    *   AT: larger question of if we can afford to shift many resources to R&D efforts - VJ: next step will be to determine how these should be prioritized alongside existing work
    *   VV: really need to validate the assumption that we can't start off with another companies cell line
        *   commercial team needs to make sure we know if there is an option for partners to provide a very productive starting cell line
    *   Important to challenge the assumption that we need extensive foundational work/tool building to generate revenue and/or have compelling data for a fundraise
        *   some of this proposed work is clearly needed for these things (FTO of OG systems) whereas this is less clear for some other work
    *   Prior to strategy review, get more clarity on total resources needed to do proposed critical work
    *   VV: Working session tomorrow for enabling R&D ahead of the strategy meeting
        *   propose a phased approach (don't try to do all the work at once)
        *   make sure to link enabling R&D work to projects whenever possible

*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731): Resourcing for extended suspension/rapid DT bovine work
Proposed work streams (not resourced / resource requirements)
1.     1. Compliant MuSC engineering - not currently resourced
        1. ~32 weeks with 1 FTE
2.     1. CRISPR screen for reduced DT (1-2 cell lines) - when do we kick this off? - not currently resourced
        1. ~14 weeks with 1.3 FTEs (allows for work in both cell lines)
        2. compliant integration of screen findings (1-2 cell lines)
        3. ~16 weeks with 1 FTE (may be combined with latter compliant MuSC work)
3.     1. Assay dev for expanded clone phenotyping capacity - **already happening** through the end of the year**!** [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) / [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) to discuss incorporating other KO clones (see below)
    2. Test remaining clones from previous KO study (use these cells as test material for #1 assay dev) - see above
        1. if we identify a clone with suspension phenotype/<24h DT then we might not need larger work stream (doesn't shorten timeline, but greatly reduces FTEs & risk)
            1. Note from Kiana clarifying this original suggestion - think it makes sense to do this if we're looking for material to run to test the scale down models are working/fit for purpose. We previously tested 2/8 clones for the two gene sets suggested here and observed no signal for single cell growth. I think testing these clones by themselves as the sole workstream for DT improvement is very high risk
4.     1. MuSC robustness/optimization can live within media development work to some degree - Emily & Nur to discuss directly

# 2024 10 15

Agenda
*   decision on BPD priorities for Nov. as 4 Humira lines come down the line along with solosis work
*   Relevant question: What quantity of cells should BPD expect for these handoffs?
*   Background Info:
    *   4 Humira cell lines (CMV, GAVPO, CMV, GAVPO PDRM1B) intended for November.
        *   Please note that timelines for delivery have been delayed, so I do not place 100% certainty on these handoff dates.
        *   The amount of cells handed off also may need a considerable expansion time. For example, the heterozygous CMV handoff was 4000 cells.
    *   We have 1 in house right now (heterozygous GAVPO) that we're testing. Heterozygous CMV is undergoing seed train expansion.
    *   Competing priorities are:
        *   DASBOX - Solosis v2 w/ Optomizer. Will Paton is BPD lead, working with Declan and Matt. 2 BRX at a time, SOL (Solosis On-Line) reactors only.
        *   DASBOX - Satellite runs for 200L scale-up. Mid November, 2 BRX needed.
        *   2L, 10L - Solosis v1 scale-up and
        *   Resources: James is 'loaned' to BPE for commissioning and scale-up.

Additionally, making sure that downstream teams have the information they need to plan their work

**Revisit how to most effectively achieve the goals of the Cross-Project meeting**
Who should attend?
*   Proposal to collect agenda items ahead of time (likely by way of product team stakeholders in the various projects or department leads) - how do we actually get this input? _No one is using the slack reminders currently_
    *   prompt people with more specific questions to get input for meeting agenda items
    *   create agenda Friday before meeting (subject to last minute changes) and request attendees accordingly
*   Vidar, Emily, Mads, Mon as regular attendees
*   Department Leads and Technical Leads to attend as needed (unless folks feel they need this regular check-in opportunity)

Who is best suited to raise cross-project topics including resource allocation changes, prioritization conflicts (physical space, resources, time), risk management, new project proposals?
*   Proposal for Emily, Mads, Mon to stay on top of this information for the projects we are associated with. Likely need to specifically check with downstream teams if issues have come up for them as we've seen oversight there in the past.
    *   with some pre-work, this team could get the information we need
*   Max, Vidar, Declan are well situated to determine if there are bottlenecks beyond projects (department level)
    *   this team can determine if other team leads will need to be in attendance - [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) to invite people as needed
*   There are some OKRs that are not part of existing projects which may involve competing priorities
    *   department heads can account for this

What sort of information will the product team want to disseminate to others during cross-project meetings? How do we best do this? Consider which of this can be done asynchronously.
*   changes or impending changes in company priorities and how that might impact projects
*   updates on hiring efforts or large purchases that impact teams
*   requests for material (board deck, commercial, otherwise) that spans multiple projects
*   requests to tune key results (data sets or product specs) we are working towards to better suite evolving BD/commercial needs

**Proposal to test out**
Coming together for a quick check-in is helpful - opportunity to raise left hands
*   could be useful to have tech team leads provide input for this
*   reformat this to a standup with PMs/team leads with clear prompts
*   ask whether people want to do prep up front or at the meeting
*   direct people to take things off-line

**Progress snapshot of project process**

# 2024 11 26

potential topics:
*   cell line handoffs to BPD: retrospective on characterizing cell lines more before they land in the bioreactors in order to save money (time).
    *   example: discovering cell lines' failure to meet the requirements in the bioreactor
    *   possible solutions:
        *   adding retrospectives that include the people doing the work and the people who can enact change (baking into the project management plan)
        *   clear requirements agreed upon along with risk management plan? baking tests into schedule = good practice
    *   _(Alex - suggestions)_
        *   _Determine priority and timeline need - if bioreactor scale proof is high(est) priority and project is under timeline pressure, then straight to bioreactor is OK. This approach will shift development needs to 15ml/250ml and require wider DOE._
            *   _AMBR15 - good for wide DOEs, not great for extensive analytics._
            *   _DASBOX (250ml) - limits DOEs (8 BRX/set appears to be throughput max per experiment), can perform more extensive analytics._
        *   _Determine resourcing availability. Flex resources from BPD if cells need more early stage development efforts._
        *   _Determine maturity of cell line and if we're taking a clonal approach or transient. Stable, mature cell lines need less testing. "1st in class" efforts would ideally have early stage testing to characterize:_
            *   _Stability - consistent growth and cell behavior over "x" passages._
            *   _Characterization - morphology, cycle analysis._
            *   _Benchmarking - if protein producer, baseline antibody production. Cell densities achieved._
            *   _Optogenetic value props - do cells behave as expected/designed in deoxys or AMBR15 environments._
            *   _Media analysis - key for determining feed strategies for production cultures._
        *   _Handoff sufficient cells for a 1-2 week seed train before inoculation._
        *   _Circle back with findings._
        *   _Document, document, document - findings should be clearly available in Benchling, stored in the right folder, and info should be complete once cell lines are handed off._

    *   98% viability today wooo!
*   Attune being finicky is a big risk - needed for current run characterization
    *   mitigation strategies: running on sorter and fixing cells
*   resources: big lift, but effectively managed thus far

[@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201)
*   this morning, discussed CLD project interlinking timelines with Opto data delivery
    *   unclear how this would impact timing - to be continued.
    *   next steps are sorted
*   Does quality really move that much?
*   CLD timeline doesnt move that much - it was already a bit too squished with Vector design. Understand how this impacts BPD/Analytics? Hires?
    *   just one hire for now for CLD

[@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561)
*   issues since Attune was down - delayed screen until this week
    *   if all goes well, will have screened all blue systems in the next two weeks
    *   will be followed with a subsequent screen (fully done by end of Q1)
*   proposal for resourcing/hiring for OG workstreams to share in ELT meeting tomorrow

[@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)

*   resourcing: Oscar is out the next two weeks (starting Fri)
    *   Need a back-up lead on Attune - possibly Alex (need to double check)
    *   data and templates will be gone after software update (next Tuesday) - [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) to share loud slack post about this
*   All good on prioritization front - discussing outsourcing analytics for BMGF through joint ventures
    *   meeting next week to discuss this
*   Need to consider resourcing if BMGF project is extended - assuming FTEs would shift away from the project later this year

[@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)
*   project manager / process / monthly update template sent out last week
*   will be scheduling quarterly progress reviews (they wont be happening soon but will be on cal's)

# Updates:
[@John Haliburton](#user_mention#54241313)
*   Risk mitigation / work planning: things are good. most limited on microbiology and vector construction. looking to order a first set of vectors for experimentation. $40-$50k range for synthesis of 17 plasmids, so conversations needed with George and Vidar
    *   need these in by march 1st . mon has already mentioned to them
*   see mon's section

[@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Risk / Hurdles: concern that the cell lines wont produced "what we want them to"
    *   strategies: additional cell line dev.
    *   decision pending: wait until whether homozygous data is back?
*   Resourcing: team is fatigued. oscar is ooo, team is stretched.
    *   workaround: bringing on help - discuss with Deniz tomorrow . TBD on whether it is temporary or long term help. expecting a decision from Deniz, wanted to discuss more details. (cell culture, maybe bridge between cld and bpd)
*   Prioritization: Know what we need to do, good with that
*   Learnings / Suggestions: Mention that illuminator plans, started with arbok. only one working shaker and will need at least one more incubator, and need at least one more shaking platform. the other one has just been moved to BPD for your arbok system.
    *   discussion offline: arbok with shaking platform, individual shake flask, etc . - [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561) / [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) . in general the shaking experiments will be increasing this year.

[@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201)
Risks:
*   We haven't got lots of vector design/protein production experience in-house, looking into consultants to de-risk second iteration of experiments. Our first indication of whether we have a vector design happens in may

*   Licensing stack is a risk - need to get a holistic view of all the components we are considering - just found out that the cloning method may be needing a license (TBD). This is Victors OKR, but we have been considering FTO with vector components, integration strategy
*   Asked George for a financial analysis of using horizon vector transposase
*   Communicated already that the optogenetics and cld vector component experiments are happening concurrently which puts the intial opto experiments at higher risk.

Notify:
*   Vector construct components cost ~50K for Experiment 1. Could then be used to chop and change parts for experiment 2-4. - Vidar and George notified.

Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?
*   **Process for customer onboarding**
*   Attune is continuing to cause issues but we have plan to bring on second one - contributing short delay each time (will start adding up)
*   Shaking platform issues - cells dying - yellow because I think this is part of growing pains but also we have plans for more space
Is team adequately resourced?
*   Okay for now given Nur joining for titer assays - moving target with new customer onboarding/new targets, team stretched thin but will be better once we can focus in
How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?
*   Felt like a moving target over last few weeks with potential for target swaps/customers but feel like things are settling down
Learnings/suggestions
*   **Scope freeze on DTPT phase 1 (<=10 targets Feb-June) soon - next or following week**
*   **Limit meetings to focus on lab work (sprint)**

[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) - Hardware
*   Risks / Hurdles:
    *   🔴 - Hardware team low resource and/or late resource risk: see below
*   Resources:
    *   🔴 - **Current wellplate illuminator requirements (quantity, functionality, quality, schedule) are several times "more" than what this team can currently support.** Company's shift toward more early stage optogenetic work incurs need for new resource allocation in the team and may lead to the delay of other illuminator work (example: 50L, but may extend to other planned systems)
*   Prioritization of work:
    *   🟡 - Gaining clarity on company objectives and how those translate into the illuminator requirements. For now, there is some uncertainty in relative priorities.
*   Learnings:
    *   Thank you to everyone who has participated in the illuminator predictions! It helps a lot

[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) - Scale-Up
*   Risks / Hurdles:
    *   🟢 - 200L in closing phase
    *   🟡 - 50L priority unclear, progress slowed. risk of not providing the appropriate scope / quality / schedule requirements.
*   Resources:
    *   🟢 - 200L Resources being released
    *   🟡 - 50L Resourcing is in highest uncertainty range due to delayed scoping decision. Need insight from leadership team about what the relative priorities are.
*   Prioritization of work:
    *   🟢 - 200L closing documents to be done before end of the month, but this can be deprioritized for other projects
    *   🟡 - 50L: see above
*   Learnings:
    *   200L "Lessons learned" document will be made after the retrospective.

[@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   🟢 Group Risks/hurdles - FYI, number of BPD/E personnel are out in 2nd half of February (Sasha, Brandon, some of James time). Experiment load is manageable, so no anticipated shortage.
*   🟢 Resources - adequate based on strategic reprioritization through July.
*   🟢 N/A on the rest.

[@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532)
*   🟡Project Hurdle- BMGF titers are lower than industry standard, which will mean higher volumes of media are required for sufficient amounts of material for PQ assessment across CV, Aggregates, Glycans, and other PTMs
    *   Mitigation- Considering a small scale purification study on recent runs to do an early PQ glycoform check, we need better cell line performance and Bio is also exploring other approaches
*   🟡 Resource- **Waiting for approval of FTE and Capex from reprioritization**
*   🟢 Prioritization- Customer = CLD>BMGF

# Updates:
[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) - general
*   made this notes sheet to remind myself to ask room about updates on whether or not we're considering a 2nd Ambr 15
*   ( [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) , et al - 2nd ambr15 was deprioritized by the last eLT decision on strategic priorities. System is still available for $60K \[$48K + $12K for 6' BSC\]. Would like to purchase if at all possible).
    *   Who wrote this? Alex?
    *   Who else would write this? Yes, it was [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) .
    *   lol ok good point thank you

[@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   🟢 Group Risks/hurdles - FYI, number of BPD/E personnel are out in 2nd half of February (Sasha, Brandon, Roshan). Nur is loaned out to DTPT at 80% of her time. Will is >60% on PM responsibilities. Experiment load is manageable, so no anticipated shortage.
*   🟢 Resources - adequate based on strategic reprioritization through July.
*   🟢 Quality Program kicked off - 1st workshop will be held on March 6th.
    *   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) perhaps its worth us communicating specifically to teams such as business/commercial the extent to which the POC will be working within the "Quality standards" and the items that will not be acted upon until later and thus the POC can't incorporate these. - Mon
        *   ([@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) ) Eric is preparing a general "Quality education" slide deck that should speak to this. The slide deck will speak to why Quality is important in the framework of a CDMO and what we're specifically tackling with the Phase 1 program.
    *   Perhaps we discuss this offline, but to what extent might the later Quality project activities (Raw materials/facilities) impact making the Opto Chassis GLP? Might we have to do a small lift on these so that the Opto chassis can be GLP? - Mon
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) - I think the impact is largely in data/documentation. However, we strictly limited the burn for the Quality program due to cost and priority concerns. We also limited the scope so as to limit impact to other groups. I did not get the impression there was much stretch on that decision.
        *   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) makes sense, im just not sure if the business outcomes have really changed in accordance. I thought Prolific is still expecting a GLP opto chassis to be engineered in Q3ish.. so we likely just need to ensure that this is appropriately communicated if its not GLP but still usable for some customer use cases.
*   🟡 BMGF - project is pivoting to new cell line due to titer issues. See [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) 's update for more information. BPD work will be squeezed on timeline (cell line handoff in March-ish), very little room for error.

[@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201)
**Risks/hurdles:**
*   🟡Lab re-org likely happening as CLD scientist is de-risking clone selection funnel (April onwards).
    *   John came up with a lab design to minimize dark work disruption (using a curtain) for Beacon install (March 3rd-10th).
*   🟡George, Victor, Max Horner and Mon joined call with WSGR about in-house vector design whilst having access to external vectors as benchmarking. The outcome was broad alignment on the strategy Mon proposed **(George evaluate whether using Horizon (or ATUM) is commercially viable for the next 5 years, in the meantime continue internal vector development and re-evaluate in April)**.

**Resources:**
*   🟢 Sent Amritha an offer for CLD scientist. verbally agreed.
*   🟡 still looking for SRA - been through 1 round of interviews. Challenging to keep driving this last week/beginning of this week (due to project/program update and reviews).
*   🟡 Need to follow up with John about Shahram's interview - it seemed people felt he would help de-risk the immediate OKRs, but unclear exactly where he might fit in the long run.
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) if I ( [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) ) remember, there was going to be a follow up meeting with Lily, John, Victor, maybe others to plan in more detail where he would fit and what his responsibilities would be... as well as [@John Haliburton](#user_mention#54241313) checking on on start date, pay, etc.

**Prioritization:**
*   ok.

[@Declan Jones](#user_mention#54153257) - Data Team
**Risks/hurdles:**
*   🟡 On-going Optomizer run has had numerous issues and won't produce sufficient/acceptable demonstration data (but is producing valuable learnings/data for next run)
    *   We had already planned a follow up run on 2/24 (This could still get us the CLC data in time for the board meeting).
*   🟢 Data infrastructure work (CLD automation and GLP data transformation) moving along at pace set by CLD assay dev and quality work
    *   Pretty much hit our limit for what we can do now before SOPs put in place, without onboarding new instruments (will kick off a new batch to address new instruments)
*   **FYI -** Proposing to kick off new project (will one brought to LT 2/25) for predictive DTPT work, another shot on goal taking a deep approach on 1-2 targets (modeling bottleneck to predict light patterns)

**Resources:**
*   🟡 **RE the upcoming project proposal:** A portion of this is lab work (likely 24dwp scale) that we don't have explicit resources for and don't want to put more pressure on the DTPT team. We have a fractional FTE from the Opto team, but **will likely need some RA support** so may ask for some resource sharing / loaning.

[@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) **regarding DTPT**
*   🟢 Planned out expanded +5 target scope to start early May
    *   seems viable from the SynBio end, but there is some target-specific prioritization/negotiation to happen with analytics as we get more clarity
*   🟡 Will need some additional TC support on and off during busy months (now - June) and have started chatting with teams we may be able to borrow from
*   🟢 Prioritization - good!
*   Notes: we are finalizing our actual run plans for the various DTPT rounds and once we have more clarity on this, we will align with hardware (and analytics when relevant)

[@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) **on behalf of Opto**
*   [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561) is in Germany, but working remotely!
*   Project Update is delayed, but let me and Max know if you have requests in the meantime
*   The team is busy hiring/onboarding people to address resource constraints (Manya started today!)

[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) **regarding Hardware**
*   🟡 🔴 Risks / Hurdles:
    *   See program updates. Essentially, hiring on the scientist side has transferred risk of bottleneck to the hardware side. We're trying to create a larger / higher quality / newer fleet of illuminators. The risks entail us doing so late, insufficiently, or with the wrong priorities. **Lots of regular communication about needs from users helps mitigate this.**
*   🟡 Resourcing:
    *   Our current team can service requests if they are prioritized and understood correctly. **We need to be kept in the loop as priorities change** because otherwise we will spend precious resources on the wrong priority.
*   🟡 Prioritization:
    *   Shaker-compatible illuminators are entering their glow-up era and more clarity is needed on what is needed when. Between a spin tube, 24 deep welll, 96 deep well, or whole-incubator, which needs to be completed when and to what degree of quality requires tradeoffs to be made.

#   

# Updates/Requests:
[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) - REQUESTS
1. timeline for new wellplate illuminators
    1. how many devices do we want in the first release (faster in your hands but fewer features) vs the 2nd release?
    2. **plan to have ~12-20 shaking compatible wellplate illuminators (split up between 96 and 24, TBD) by late april at the earliest. ~1 month later than such devices were requested.**
    3. will there be any delays such as due to the merck cell line availability issue?
        1. Max Ho: current availability of CHOZN line is impacting timelines - don't yet know what the delay is
            1. When does hardware team need info what is needed from OG team. - need to know in the next 2 weeks [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561) and [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to keep hardware aware of impacts
            2. Can still make progress without these, but there will be impacts
    4. **workarounds (luxio x5/ lumiplate x1 / mla-1 x1) in the meantime, but some preparation is needed so please discuss ahead of time.**
        1. Biostrategy team to discuss how we prioritize use of these up until end of April batch is ready - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to schedule
        2. discuss where illuminators will be and what attachment strategy to use
    5. even with 20 machines, this is likely lower than what is requested until june when another 15 or so devices can be made (and glp compliance can be developed). assuming all requested illuminators need to be used all the time. i am hoping user teams can help us navigate this through scheduling and discussing such as in CPAM ahead of usage surges
    6. spin tube board? do we dedicate a board or two for spin tube illuminator?
2. what is the best in-incubator setup attachment mechanism of a shaking wellplate illuminator? we would like to know as we design the new deoxys.
    1. question: what is the current availability of shaking space for illuminators? how many illuminators could we support right now hypothetically? and will this change in may?
3. when can we install the arbok in the infors? and where? and do we want one in a kuhner too still? should one of them be a spin tube arbok? ([@John Haliburton](#user_mention#54241313) [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689))

[@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   🟡 Group Resources/Risks:
    *   Roshan has left the company. Backfill is approved, but on hold until throughput warrants. Asks from other projects may move this backfill up to present day. - _there is an ask from Optomizer v2_
    *   Nur's rotation to Bio has been terminated. ELISAs are back in Bio's hands.
    *   Will rotation work is increasing, likely at 70% external/ 30% BPD starting mid March/early April.
    *   Need to check handoff assumptions against latest CHOZN news. BPD workplate will need rearranging (by me) if CLD dev is impacted.
    *   Asks from other projects:
        *   Optomizer 2.0(?): 0.5 FTE of RA from April - July. 0.2 FTE of Sr Sci/Eng for DOE assist.
        *   Tentacool/ 50L Startup: 1 FTE RA for two weeks (March), tentative startup assistance in May timeframe.
*   🟡 Projects:
    *   🟢 Quality Program kicked off - 1st workshop will be held on March ~~6th.~~ sometime.
        *   Scope is inclusive of Opto Chassis work.
        *   Will have hardware representation at workshop to account for GLP assessment of illuminator workflows.
        *   Analytics will either have spot representation as time allows or will attend post workshop digest (set for week after workshop).
        *   Eric Schulze is accountable for working with LT for general program questions and providing guidance on Quality needs for Prolific.
    *   🟡 Optomizer looks to be having more challenges than originally anticipated. May require additional experiments beyond original scope.
    *   🟡 BMGF - project is pivoting to new cell line due to titer issues. Not anticipating cell line handoff until late March/ early April.

[@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532)
*   Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?
    *   🟢 No new risks have manifested, encountered some areas that need technical development
    *   🟡 BMGF work likely to now fall when CLD work is ramping
*   Is your team adequately resourced?
    *   🟡 We have gaps, if onsite interviews go well we'll be in a better place before we'll be in a worse place
*   How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?
    *   My understanding for my team's resource allocation: Customer projects > CLD > BMGF (🟢 if correct)

[@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) [@John Haliburton](#user_mention#54241313)
*   **Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?**
    *   🔴 **ALIGN:** CHOZN stock completely depleted.
        *   Main impact on Opto Dev work (they are ready to use the line in the next 1-2 weeks). If we go with CHOZN GSKO or CHOZN Elite, then Opto team might be able to do some dev work with the WT CHOZN line we have in house.
        *   Assessing several options, meeting again on Friday once have more info:
            *   Catalent line
            *   Getting line from Merck freezer (not GMP)
            *   Getting line from CMO associated with Merck
            *   Getting CHOZN Elite from Merck in 3 weeks
            *   Horizon line (will have redlined by Friday but meeting the following week to go over terms).
    *   🟢 We had a [risk session](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BVLoL5nTHsrzY4OwlT0alute_3y8qBo6rsjAf4efSBg/edit?gid=1216737423#gid=1216737423) for program today, identified 69 risks total - document still WIP
        *   
    *   🟡 Waiting on lab move timeline from Tom to understand how it impacts the R&D work that needs to happen during that time. " putting a phased move plan together... first phase is move most everything with in a weekend, except the Tecan.  Then the Tecan will take about 2 days is my guess.." - Tom.
    *   🟡 connected to the align below: Could be challenging to prep for Titer and Quality funnel as Basanta is helping quantify DTPTs using ELISA. [@John Haliburton](#user_mention#54241313) confirm?
    *   🟡 Vector component experiment 1 = critical for Clone funnel dev. If not successful could use other cell line expressing protein, but not ideal since could have a different background.
*   *   **Is your team adequately resourced?**
    *   🟡 Vector component interviews likely strain resources.
    *   We have managed to spend some resources to help the DTPT team with quantification and spin tube set up as it aligns with CLD pipeline dev.
*   **How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?**
    *   🟡 **ALIGN :** Need some alignment on company priority for titer funnel vs quality funnel.
        *   If we reach 2-3g/L our understanding is we would then take the quality funnel - this screens 50 clones for quality against the pool (this method is what people in industry have said they do as it provides early product for tox studies).. Note this will hopefully also lead to clones with higher titers, but titer in this case is not the major metric.
        *   Alternatively, the titer funnel screens 384 clones and thus has a higher likelihood of reaching 7g/L (the deliverable for the KR).
        *   [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) and John, Mon, Ian align offline.

*   [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561)
*   Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?
    *   🔴 Merck CHOZN-GSko line not available. Starting from next week, the availability of the cell line is on the critical path and will delay development of optogenetic chassis lines (both R&D (KR1.1) and compliant (KR1.3)).
    *   If not (🟢), share a quick win!
    *   If new risks/hurdles (🟡 🔴 ), what changes/delays have happened since last meeting and what mitigation strategies have been deployed? Any help needed from this group?
*   Is your team adequately resourced?
    *   🟡 We made Seesha an offer as a Scientist I but has not yet accepted.
    *   🟡 Hiring of AAV scientist will not be completed in March (rather May). Likely Makoto (starts Mid March) needs to start working on this project in order to be able to generate data by end of year (patent deadline). Limited number of suitable candidates.
*   How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?
    *   🟢 With the new hires we are on the right track.
*   Any learnings, suggestions, wins, or other items to share with this group?
    *   🟢 Optogenetic gene expression system screening and development of new/improved systems worked very well and we also have red light system that we can use for the generation of the Chassis line.
    *   🟡 Need to discuss with hardware on Illuminator requirements.

[@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?
    *   As mentioned last meeting, the team has changed cell lines from CHO-K1 to ExpiCHO due to suboptimal cell line performance which has delayed cell line handoff to BPD and pushed timelines back a few weeks. The team is meeting Friday to discuss any additional work that can be performed during this time to mitigate process risks in advance of new cell line availability.
*   Is your team adequately resourced?
    *   We are currently under resourced but are actively recruiting a contract senior research associate and have sent out a job offer with a tentative start date of March 17th.
    *   Oscar will be away March 28th-April 8th so will be extremely resource limited if new hire doesn't onboard beforehand.
*   How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?
    *   Some concern around discussion of wanting to change the aims of the Gates Foundation grant to better align with company priorities ie changing from relative titer improvement to 10g/L yield and what that means for current strategy and timeline.

[@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) 🟢 🟡
*   Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?
    *   Ensuring we have a plan for DTPT runs
        *   🟢 Tested 3 ELISAs so far this week - we are able to quantify protein produced by CMV for 3 DTPTs - next 3 targets to be tested this week
        *   🟢 De-risking option to include His tags on targets - ordered DNA both with and without His tag so we have the option
        *   🟡 Conversations with data team on expansion of DTPT (thinking about this as additional work stream), testing more illumination patters for 1-2 targets to increase shots on goal for production and also provide data for modeling - this work is actively being scoped, not yet resourced, and cannot be resourced by existing DTPT team
    *   🟡 Some back and forth on finalizing targets (balance between customer asks/data set targets) which we hope to finalize for this round ASAP
    *   🟡 Team has not had sufficient time to begin planning secretory phenotype work - currently brainstorming ways to address this well in advance of Q3 start
*   Is your team adequately resourced?
    *   Team is at capacity but working efficiently and has communicated things are manageable and we have measures in place to communicate when they are not
*   How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?
    *   🟢 Comfortable

*   Group Resources/Risks (🔴 Alignment Needed):
    *   **Background:** See [BPD Team Meeting](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/dc/12h8j1-9780/12h8j1-74131) for discussion of projects and throughput concerns.
        *   The board has asked PM to find ways to reduce burn, therefore, there is some preference to hold on a backfill for BPD until the throughput warrants it. BPD is down 1.7 FTE (backfill for RA and Will's rotation). Backfill was (previously) approved for the RA, no backfill was requested for Will's rotation.
        *   BPD's current allocation has two main projects (BMGF and CLD POC) which are mostly supportable with our current resources as-is. However, there are three projects asking for resources from BPD (DTPT Optomizer at 50% of RAs time, Tentacool for 20% - 50% of RA, and Opportunistic Optomizer at TBD) that are not possible to support w/o a backfill.
    *   **Caveats:**
        *   CHOZN Elite is arriving later than CHOZN line was originally planned, so CLD Pipeline work likely won't hit BPD until June (??).
            *   MNH: See previous comment.
        *   Optomizer DTPT may be able to resource with CLD RA (Declan to confirm).
        *   Resource crunch is primarily in RA - Tentacool and Optomizer would account for nearly all RA time.
    *   **Ask:** Recommend the projects clarify resource needs and/or align on priority based on needs for July board meeting. LT or eLT to issue decision.
        *   If we need all three, then I'll work with George and Christina to explore backfill possibilities.
        *   If current situation holds, recommend Optomizer DTPT receive priority resourcing, and then no support for Opportunistic Optomizer or Tentacool runs.
Group notes:
*   out of 3 possible efforts, Optomizer DTPT is highest priority, Optimizer (opportunistic) shouldn't be needed, and 50L should be done opportunistically
*   need to re-evaluate CLD vs. other R&D asks based on ongoing conversations based on outcomes of board meeting
*   Follow-up discussions with Alex in the future

[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
*   Hurdles
    *   The team is over capacity (>100% utilization) still receiving spot requests (e.g., DXS-IR TEST, Sparbok, Luxio interface plate). Each "small request" adds prioritization overhead.
        *   **Current Mitigation:**
            *   Starting to say no to increases in request complexity.
            *   Improving communication about our three ongoing projects with Agile-style Product Owners.
            *   Educating colleagues on our constraints and fostering trust among team leads.
            *   Please remind your teams of the resourcing imbalance if delays arise.
    *   Max Hu OOO - multiple decisions delayed / airtable-related issues
        *   **Current Mitigation:** Delaying decisions where possible, moving forward with best-guess decisions were necessary, and finding workarounds
        *   **Future Mitigation:** Is it possible for us to consider the merits of hiring to take front end and database development off of the CTO's docket?
        *   Examples: New controller board came in and airtable config isn't communicating → bringup of 50 boards delayed. Arbok revival requires firmware revival and we have to do workarounds in the meantime
*   Resourcing
    *   As stated above, we need to be saying "no" or "not yet" to requests for new deliverables or to requests that increase the complexity of currently scoped deliverables.
*   Prioritization
    *   As a service-oriented team, we are always open to feedback on the priorities.
    *   Please see the priorities in our [Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CEPHwV3G80AFySbw_tnbIZ-377k-miBP0i5uxh7yHao/edit?usp=sharing).
    *   Please also see our [Release Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CEPHwV3G80AFySbw_tnbIZ-377k-miBP0i5uxh7yHao/edit?usp=sharing) for Well plate illuminators
*   Suggestion for the group:
    *   Our team is going to be under extreme pressure in the months of April - June because we have several high impact deliverables. Please make requests using work orders with as much advance notice as possible and please share this context with your teams!!
Discussion:
*   prioritize hardware efforts based on the projects they enable (especially if we need to cut back)
*   Should we prioritize some store-bought low tech solutions to free up hardware bandwidth? They can also add overhead - further discussion here
    *   where could the hardware team do less? What can opto team take responsibility for [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561)

*   [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561): Suggestion: Consider some low-tech intermediate solutions, e.g. regular LED strips without WiFi/Airtable controller for Arbok/Sparbok. Installation/intensity measurements can be done by the Optogenetics team. Maybe this is freeing up some resources.
    *   (update from Mads 3/20) - this concept was explored with key stakeholders and it was determined that this solution would not meet the requirements for DTPT experiments (limited power range, limited pulsing). so we will be installing a regular arbok. it has been communicated that since we didn't find a labor-reducing solution, lower priority work orders will only be serviced opportunistically

[@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) / [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689)
*   Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?
    *   🟡Not really - learned there were expectations that DTPT titer reach 1g/L well before EOY which will not happen - Kiana is working on plans to reach this goal ASAP (closer to EOY)
*   Is your team adequately resourced?
    *   🟡Synbio alone is not, but the assay dev team (Mare/John) are helping de-risk production runs and we will get some analytics help as well which makes things more feasible
*   How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?
    *   Comfortable -
        *   need to make sure we get the illuminators and infors space we need for production runs (mid April - onward)
        *   continued support from assay dev/analytics will be key
*   ⚠️Warning that DTPT is using the 2nd tier of existing infors for light experiments for the forseeable future - let us know if this is an issue!

Each attendee to give a 🟢 🟡 🔴 to the following and elaborate as described:
*   **Any risks/hurdles identified or that have manifested?**
    *   🟡 🔴MTA redline with Merck for CHOZN Elite. Charles River being set up to bank the cells 2 week TAT from receiving vial. **Mid April aiming for having bank of vials for engineering.**
    *   🟢 🟡 Getting alignment on work the CLD team will do post board meeting.
        *   further alignment coming this week and next within the bio team
            *   Does seem to have broad alignment on moving GLP Opto Chassis 3-6 months
            *   Does seem to align on not doing GLP 6m TAT POC CMV in July
            *   Instead focus on vector component work and Opto CLD Pipeline set up to aid DTPT/Opto R&D reach high titers. Potentially aiding extra engineering/stable pool testing that the opto/DTPT team need - discussion next week.
            *   Long and slow set up of GLP project to improve internal standards.
    *   🟢 Lab move going ahead next week. Work scheduled to be completely finished by April 6.
*   **Is your team adequately resourced?**
    *   🟡We have missed Basanta but he will hopefully be back next week to help with the assay dev sprint for DTPT.
    *   🟡 In line with shifting focus of CLD team, we are assessing the Vector design scientist hire - internal alignment happening. Vidar is also asking Julien for his take on the ideal profile of the protein engineering scientist suggestion - trying to understand if this is the same role as vector design sci, different ( in addition or instead of), or consultant etc.
    *   🟢 Amritha and Shahram set to join April 1
*   **How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?**
    *   🟢🟡 I foresee in the future needing to align on what samples analytics should run when. Eg. analytics aiding the DTPT/Opto teams is priority but also spending some time reading out the (opto)CLD Pipeline could also aid titers for DTPT/Opto team. Hence, we will work on the opportunistic hand off timing.
    *   🟢 We will create a waterfall chart to show the improvements in titer that we might expect for each component of the Opto CLD Pipeline so that research can be prioritized. - Get Shahram's input.
    *   🟡 In biostrategy we will make a list of the different extra engineering that **_could_** be done so that we can prioritize where the resource might be spent instead of the GLP engineering/ how to best integrate learnings from the beginning of the year to DTPT/Opto - Whilst the vector component work will be one element going throughout the year, I imagine CLD team will be asked to help engineer/test high priority items if DTPT/Opto need assistance - TBD. Eg.
        *       *   CMV lines for additional mAbs Opto might test
            *   or integrating vector component work into opto/dtpt work.

# Updates/Requests:
[@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
*   **A shortage has been prophesied! Please weigh in!**
    *   Context
        *   6 deoxes fit on a shaking incubator shelf (due to size and weight constraints). Noreen and Zack have recent results that suggest shaking 96 HDWP at the 25 mm throw instead of the 3 mm throw is yielding better results. This may mean that the 25 mm throw becomes much more popular for illuminating than the 3 mm throw as it may support both 24 DWP and 96 HDWP illuminated experiments.
        *   We have only one 25 mm shelf (6 machines) dedicated for shaking.
            *   12 total shaking spots (6x 25 mm level and 6x 3mm level) appears to be insufficient compared to estimated demand even without this shift, but the shift makes it even more dire.
    *   Hoping to elicit mitigation ideas from more senior members of this group. I am curious if managing incubator resources for illuminators is an expectation of the hardware team, and if not, then who should I consult?
    *   **Action:** [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) send message about this in biostrategy - make sure we get Shahram and Amritha's input - then decide how to adjust our instrumentation (50 mm for spin tubes validated by Merck)
        *   ideally test hardware with throws and speeds we will be using (don't have 50 mm space for this)
*   Risks 🟡
    *   Other than above no new risks are materializing
    *   Biggest risk remains that HW team is stretched thin and cannot accommodate any material increase in workload. We are navigating this by increased coordination / communication efforts, planning ahead, anticipating risks and mitigating, etc.
    *   **If your predicted illuminator usage changes in either quantity, features, or time needed, please let us know.**
*   Resources 🟡
    *   See above
*   Prioritization 🟡
    *   Curious to hear if anyone has thoughts on the relative priority of a bespoke spin tube illuminator compared to Deoxys.

[@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   🟢 No new risks
*   🟢 No new resourcing updates - down 2.2 FTE. Roshan backfill is postponed, Will rotation to PM group and Brandon on 0.5 FTE rotation to DTPT AI effort.
*   🟢 Project Priorities:
    *   BMGF (Sasha lead, April:July)
    *   Platform Process Development (Nur lead, partially based on opportunistic handoffs from CLD. May include early intensification efforts if time/budget allows).
    *   Tentacool (opportunistic support via James).

[@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) / [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) DTPT update:
*   🟢 No new significant risks
*   🟡🟢 We have sufficient resources for planned work thanks to shared resources from assay dev/CLD, analytics, BPD
*   Prioritization 🟢
    *   We are gearing up to begin generation of final v1 DTPT lines while we continue de-risking production runs (hardware, opto, assay dev, etc.) - these items require lots of shaking culture space (of varying scales over time), hardware installs, illumination runs. **We will do our very best to notify anyone who might be impacted ahead of time! We are hoping that installation of the new infors can help relieve some of this pressure :D**
        *   near complete use of current infors second shelf for assay dev, illumination testing, production runs etc. for the next couple months
        *   up to 8 x 24 DWP spots in 2ish weeks
        *   space for ~45 shake flasks required in 3-5 weeks

**Wins:**
*   🟢 CHOZN Elite on-site GLP Banking underway.
    *   will ship remaining cells in cryovial to Charles River next week for GLP Banking
*   🟢 Amritha and Shahram joined! Currently aligning plans with their thoughts.

**Is your team adequately resourced?**
*   🟡 John looking at CVs for vector design hire. We don't have redundancy in the lab for those efforts currently, so work stops when John is busy.

**How comfortable are you with the prioritization of work you're involved in and and are priorities translating to practice?**
*   🟢Current priorities of setting up pipeline with the focus on aiding R&D is translating into practice. Eg. **aiding DTPT production runs.**
*   🟢Just to be explicit - We are still focused on the pipeline enabling customer work in 2026 that can theoretically be performed in 4-6m TAT. However, the **in-lab work overlaps with assay optimization that will be useful for other teams depending on when results are available - confirming deliverable timing with Amritha/Shahram.**
    *   " **KR 2.2b** Create a roadmap for a CLD pipeline designed to achieve a 6-month TAT (receipt of DNA to RCB) by the end of Q4 (unverified) that can achieve metrics of KR2.1 and onboard four R&D targets beginning Q1 ‘26 (with FTO)., [John Haliburton](mailto:john@prolific-machines.com) Updated | Approved by accountable LT owner; to be signed off"
    *   **KR 2.2c** Create an optogenetic cell-line development pipeline by the end of the year, designed to engineer high-titer protein-producing CHO lines and detect product titers across multiple scales in Beacon, 24/96 DWP, and shake flask/spin tube volumes.  [John Haliburton](mailto:john@prolific-machines.com) Updated | Approved by accountable LT owner; to be signed off
**Transfer info:**
*   For Max to follow up with other bio leads/team:
    \- Shahram & Amritha felt that testing chassis lines with mAb was important. Suggested to use the LP to integrate target (that was how this clone was found). Suggested could also test transiently to see response to high copy number (strategy that is currently being done?). Shahram suggested to use cold staining - he is familiar with this I believe and we have ordered the antibodies.

*   **Format:**
    *   collect project-based summaries ideally by EOD the Friday prior (roadblocks, risks, priorities, etc.)
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to determine if there are specific discussions/alignment that should happen IN the meeting
        *   if so, block off an appropriate amount of time for the discussion(s) and decide whether to add any other required individuals to the meeting

**Current form:**
*   Timing: 20 minutes every other week
*   Attendees: All PMs, project architects, technical leads, and interested LT members attend
*   Format: collect update summaries ahead of time (per project/team) and do a round table where folks speak to specific items they want to run by the group
    *   a list of follow-up actions are compiled and disseminated

**Questions:**
*   do all projects have PMs now? If not, we need to make sure that all projects are represented. For example, does the 50L project have a PM?
*   do PMs feel like they have sufficient communication with architects/tech team leads to speak to items listed under _meeting intent_ and _decision rights_ (above)?

# 2025 04 29

*   align on what new structure (core PM group) looks like (add Alex!)
    *   do we stick with the same stand-up prompts?
    *   how do we warn others when they are needed in time for specific discussions?
    *   are all projects represented across this group? What about 50L, for example?
*   are CPRM and the existing PM standup both needed?

# 2025 05 13

**Meeting Intent:** Stand-up on cross-functional team needs, cross-project risks, priorities.

**Decision Rights (note: this may become Discussion Topics due to Bio/PM alignment on decision making authority)**
*   Plan adjustments

    *   Individuals may be asked to join (by any of the PMs) on a case-by-case basis if they are needed for a specific discussion
*   **Format:**
    *   PMs should update their project status at minimum 24 hours before the meeting. The updates should be made available to interested attendees at that time.
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to determine if there are specific discussions/alignment that should happen IN the meeting
        *   if so, ensure that the required decision makers and inform individuals are asked to attend. Block off an appropriate amount of time for the discussion(s), ensure that other critical topics are accounted for in team meetings or other venues.
    *   Action items should be tracked and individuals assigned for resolution. Follow up can take place in this meeting or other project venues.

# **Hardware -** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   The team is suffering from lack of documentation/ tech debt / faulty handoffs made under time pressure from last minute requests.
*   In order to say yes to anything else (any of the 10 last minute requests we get every week) **we absolutely need to hire someone.** **It can be a junior technician, but we need help.**
*   Please continue to update the [2025 Illuminator Usage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pknq1lUJLnQdMEJt9LPvKB80ny768r17B327WbnlpPc/edit?usp=sharing) sheet whenever you have a major project update that necessitates way more or way fewer or different illuminators
*   Current Projects
    *   Scoped: DX2, Tentacool, Calibration System, New Controllers / Firmware / Airtable
    *   In downtime: Sp/Arbok improvements, Spinda, Fixing things that break
        *   I am considering pressing on Sp/Arbok and delaying all improvements officially until after DX2 rollout.
*   **Action:** @mads to noodle on this and keep us posted
### DX2 Update
*   Goal: 15 shaking well plate illuminators for DTPT, PRADA, CLD, Opto, BMGF, all the acronyms really.
*   May-June arrival
*   Slow week, team will be doing power system work while waiting for the May 29 arrival of circuit boards. This week is more focused on Tentacool

### Tentacool Update
*   Goal: 1x 50L illuminator for 50L Project
*   It is going well and on time. This is a big week for testing and integrating the system.

# **CLD** [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201)
**cross project alignments:**
*   John said he would talk to Alex T about Brandon's time allocation to working with Basanta/Shahram. Currently Basanta feels quite stretched.
*   Irfan has asked the hardware team if they can cut down some black foam on the Ambr system (likely not high priority, just flagging). Think BMGF are the ones who still plan to use Ambr in the short term.
*   Any team members who want to use the Beacon and haven't done the training should talk to CLD about it.
*   Illuminator requests - CLD are still defining deliverables so illuminator planning is a stage beyond this. However, John thought it might be good to first identify how many illuminators can we actually fit and where.
    *   Mads says Basanta and Cooper are leading this effort. Need to ask them for an update.
*   Alignment with Opto (agreed by Max Horner in writing):
    *   Opto and CLD will align on criteria for narrowing down clones
    *   First opto screens will be done using mScarlet expression to narrow to 24 clones per chassis
    *   Those 24 clones per chassis will be handed to CLD. For CLD to test CLD pipeline (electroporation, vectors, copy number analysis, stability etc).
    *   We have another alignment meeting driven by Shahram on Wednesday as he felt there were some loose ends.
[@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) has this been cleared on the analytics front
*       *   monitor Octet usage
    *   warn analytics ahead of time for support we need!

**CLD group:**
*   Working on objectives/deliverables list.
*   ongoing alignment with Will on reporting on Shahram's work as some of it is:
    *   either to directly help BMGF work (optimizing seed density and feed for ExpiCHO protein production)
    *   or it may fall quite close to light sensitivity work (seed density, feed for CHO-E protein production) - work begins after opto host cells handed to Shahram.
    *   currently they are reported on in CLD team meeting.

## PRADA - Will
*   Resourcing for production runs - heavy reliance on Brandon for 4+ weeks (and we still don't have confirmation that he can be 100% allocated to PRADA)
    *   Possibility for Friday support for harvest &/or seeding?
*   Just got a great update from Emily! Keep 'em coming!

## BMGF - Will
*   Nessa is submitting a grant extension request this week
    *   Asking for +7 months, so project will be completed ~3/1/26
    *   This will enable integration of Humira into CHOZNe
    *   **Waiting on more info from Max Hoerner on delivery date of CHOZNe chassis line before sending grant extension**
        *   We heard the cell line is delayed, and will be using that Chassis line for this project.
*   Waiting on Gates Foundation to approve to our progress update (submitted ~6 weeks ago) before they can review the grant extension

## Opto Derisking - Will
*   **FYI: We are kicking off an initiative to coalesce "Opto Derisking" efforts under one roof.** (This work has already been happening, but without PM support)
*   This involves developing more fundamental understanding of our cells, opto systems, and protein production processes and derisking future
*   Scientists Involved: Sasha, Nur, Shahram, Amritha, Basanta, Zack H
    *   Informed: Alex T, Matt, Max Hoerner

## **DTPT - Emily**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   The team is using shared resources heavily (infors, dark hoods, flow) - curious if this has been an issue for others? We expect this to last through June
*   Handoffs to analytics / PRADA are being discussed elsewhere - please let me know if more info is useful!
*   Need to figure out where AltruBio work will live
*   Confusion around where DTPT v2 will live

## **Opto chassis - Emily**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   Max will share an updated timeline by tomorrow which is important for handoffs to various groups
    *   the chassis are definitely delayed to some degree and handoff timing depends on how well characterized people want the chassis to be
*   Decision for team members to get trained on Octet and Valita in order to execute those within Opto as needed (will still try to collaborate with analytics as much as possible)
*   AAV lab buildout in progress - hopefully this doesn't impact people too much??
*   Continued communication within biostratgy around what team owns each type of CHOZN-elite optimization will be important (thanks Mon for some recent updates)
    *   for now Opto is working through GS selection and is optimizing transfection because this is an immediate hurdle

# 2025 05 27

**Reminder to** [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731): take comprehensive notes to share with the broader team and follow up on last meetings' actions as well as items in the slack thread

**Meeting Intent:** Stand-up on cross-functional team needs, cross-project risks, priorities.

**Decision Rights (note: this may become Discussion Topics due to Bio/PM alignment on decision making authority)**
*   Plan adjustments
*   Addressing conflicts across projects
*   Prioritization of use of physical resources across projects
*   Risk management strategies
*   July Board Meeting Sprint

**Overview:**
*   **Timing:** 30 minutes every other week
*   **Attendees:** All PMs are mandatory to attend. Optional attendees are interested downstream or department team leads and LT members
    *   Individuals may be asked to join (by any of the PMs) on a case-by-case basis if they are needed for a specific discussion
*   **Format:**
    *   PMs should update their project status at minimum 24 hours before the meeting. The updates should be made available to interested attendees at that time.
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to determine if there are specific discussions/alignment that should happen IN the meeting
        *   if so, ensure that the required decision makers and inform individuals are asked to attend. Block off an appropriate amount of time for the discussion(s), ensure that other critical topics are accounted for in team meetings or other venues.
    *   Action items should be tracked and individuals assigned for resolution. Follow up can take place in this meeting or other project venues.

## **Follow-up from last meeting and relevant follow-on (please add if I missed some):**
*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) to noodle on resource constraints, time pressure, technical debt, etc. that hardware is experiencing and get help from this group as needed
    *   Identified that prioritization can be improved using a better ownership structure. We are adding [device owners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4NAEQpHV0j_gxEXmpnLeNRd3cmRs0ixB8J1KxsI2yM/edit?usp=sharing) (person who is ultimately accountable for quality of devices) - hypothesis being that if people are accountable then they are less likely to accept time pressure or technical debt, providing a needed forcing function for tough prioritization decisions.
    *   Also, we are hiring another technician!
*   Re-sourcing challenges/requests for Shahram/Basanta's work and PRADA project ([@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245))
    *   Brandon needs to be out of the lab due to injury
    *   need help with immediate 24 DWP runs (Brandon can't help Nora with this)
    *   PRADA will need 1.25 FTE for this
        *   how do we escalate this to getting a temp - Brandon could train them [@Declan Jones](#user_mention#54153257) to escalate ASAP (chat with Lily ahead of time)
    *   Intern for the automation team will help Basanta (CLD is addressed)
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) **send @vidar info from Shahram's biostrategy meetings - Mon sent the request.**
        *   [Opto Derisking Data Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pv636sy4JvRUqkw2TqkaOW053YUPu4lgHrEzwCMPGkU/edit?slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316#slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316)
    *   re: Shahram's work - **Opto Derisking Program** is being formalized
        *   90116199988 ([https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/o/f/90116199988?pr=90112169431](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/o/f/90116199988?pr=90112169431))
*   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) / [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to work together on establishing a home for discussions/updates related to light sensitivity work (overlap with CLD)
    *   PMs agreed on how to present in updates
    *   Will is PM for **Opto Derisking Program**
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to figure out where Green Apple work will live & clarify what falls within CLD vs. DTPT v2 - done
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) ensure Max shares updated timeline for opto chassis handoff - June 23
*   Address how projects/product/tech roadmaps all fit together - done
## **DTPT - Emily**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   The team will continue using certain resources (infors, dark hoods, flow) heavily through the end of June - let me know if there are specific resource issues!
    *   let's all keep an eye out and jump on issues before they spin out of control; very little room for error
*   We are in full production run/data generation mode and will try and share key results rapidly as we have them
*   Handoff to PRADA is being prioritized more now that production runs are on their way. [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) and I will facilitate this over the next couple of weeks
*   The Green Apple project will be led by Kiana (in collab. with Opto) and I will be the PM. There will be a lot of overlap with DTPT v2
    *   There is overlap between this work and Opto (Beacon selection), BMGF (secretory phenotype), and CLD (general CLD pipeline development) so communication and coordinate are extra important

## PRADA - Will
*   **Brandon has repeated use injury - will need lab additional support**
*   Still working on additional RA resourcing for PRADA
    *   Brandon to spend 40-50% of time on BPD work (likely 2 days per week)
    *   Additional support needed for running titer assays and seeding days (Fridays)
*   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) - how much delay can we afford here?
    *   there are various challenges so what is the drop dead date where we choose to not launch the project
*   [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) How do we avoid repetitive use injuries?
    *   we have not had training about lab injury risks - Tom, [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) to address how to avoid this
    *   managers should check with folks about this
## **Opto chassis - Emily**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   We shared an updated timeline for Opto chassis handoffs last week. Are there any follow up questions? There are a lot of caveats to chassis delivered in June (i.e. they are not selected for protein secretion and haven't been evaluated for stability).
*   AAV lab buildout - certain equipment can't/shouldn't be moved back and forth between labs (like illuminators) so we're doing some coordinating to understand what can go in the AAV space without inconveniencing others, what we need to purchase, etc.
    *   I posted more context on the channel, but is everyone OK if 2 luxios are moved from general circulation into the AAV lab starting around August? This would leave 2-3 remaining in the main circulation - [https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C077NV0ABEF/p1747865347053949](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C077NV0ABEF/p1747865347053949)
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to ask Max if Aug 6 is ok - PRADA will need 4 luxios at least until data deadline for board deck
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) link luxio request message above
*   FYI there are more delays with the all-in-one fast tracked method Opto use working on due to issues with vectors that were inherited. I'll clarify timing impacts when we have them - **~2 week delay**
*   There are still challenges related to Opto resources being us to do a lot of CHOZN-elite workflow development - is there any way CLD can do this in a time that works for Opto
    *   how many copies do we get with piggybac
    *   how do we transfect?
    *   how do we get GS working?
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) ask Max for specific asks/trade-offs related to this
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to chat about prioritization within CLD/Shahram work in CLD tech lead meeting.
## **Hardware - Mads**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
_All dates are approximate._
*   Wellplate illuminator ([DX2](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901109353931)):
    *   **Delivery Delayed by ~1 week**
    *   **First Device = June 9, Second Device = June 13**, Next 13 Devices released ~ 2 weeks after that.
*   50L Illuminator ([Tentacool](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901107129487)):
    *   **Development is complete,** **first (ideally only)** **run is June 9-13**
*   Incubator Illuminator (Sp/[Arbok](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110355993)):
    *   Work in progress, lower priority than DX2 and Tentacool, so development is opportunistic. Complete remodel of the infrastructure that runs Sp/Arboks.
    *   **Approximately July 10: Users can use all Sp/Arbok without Mads. Some may be available before then.**
    *   2 Sparboks in Infors. No concrete plans for another though CLD will probably need one (please let me know when the approximate ideal install date is known)
*   Spin Tube Illuminator ([Spinda](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110136609)):
    *   No concrete delivery yet. ROM estimate = August for usage of first Spinda device. Baxter will likely be assigned to this after Tentacool work levels off.
*   Optowell (Luxio) Calibration:
    *   Calibration of optowell devices has been requested by June 13.
    *   First option: Dani will look into automating the data measurement portion of calibrating. Data formatting and upload likely left to users with oversight.
    *   Second option: Semi-automated data measurement (done by hw team). Data formatting and upload likely left to users with oversight.
    *   Third option: Manual data measurement (done by users with instructions from hw team). Data formatting and upload likely left to users with oversight.

# CLD Cross project relevant notes
*   Kelmen leaving. Arun remaining until I believe Sept (reports to John).
    *   Team will address the automation deliverables as best as possible.
    *   Arun can use the Tecan and will address the deliverables that are to do with liquid handling. However, integration of Tecan with other instruments will wait.
*   New automation intern (Peyja) has lots of cell culture experience so this helps the FTE shortage for Basanta that I brought up last week (Start July 1st).
*   CLD has added Rituxan and Enbrel to the targets we are producing.
    *   Mon started communication with Analytics about this **but need to follow up on a message received from Ian post meeting with John (when things were clarified).**
    *   Rituxan chosen because it was the target in the Demeetra plasmid (a known working plasmid) - it was important for us to have a positive control to understand whether it was the plasmid or transfection conditions for example that needed optimizing.
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to highlight this is only as a control plasmid.
    *   Enbrel added because it is a different single chain protein that Merck collected data on in CHO-E. Additionally, it may be that we are having difficulty expressing Blinatumomab in John's vector construct optimization experiments (Enbrel = backup single chain protein).
    *   Likely have clones from either Humira or Rituxan cell lines end of June/Beg July (Just found out) - **Will be included in communication to Analytics. Ideally design a study with Analytics to compare Octet and HPLC Rank order of clones.**
*   CLD have proposed reverting one of our KRs to similar to what it was prior to the board meeting. The timeline was crunched due to pressure to provide a process for opto chassis selection. However, now it is aligned that we will be working on optimizing the process in parallel to opto.
    *   Suggested KR2.2: directional conventional pool data end of Q3. 7g/L end of Q4.
    *   Fiona talking to LT about it tomorrow.
*   Discussing with CLD tech leads about what illuminators are needed for the deliverables now that we have a deliveables list (put on the agenda for tech lead meeting Thursday).

## BMGF
*   agreed to a 7 month extension
*   still determining if it will be paid for
*   this delays all timelines
*   hopeful that analytical work for the new target can happen externally

## Actions
*   [@Declan Jones](#user_mention#54153257) to see if PRADA can get a temp hire ASAP (discuss with Lily first)
*   All - keep an eye out and jump on issues lab space/resource issues before they spin out of control; very little room for error in the coming months
*   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) to work with Tom and sort out training for lab users to prevent repeated use injury
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) / [@Declan Jones](#user_mention#54153257) to monitor feasibility of PRADA and adjust plans accordingly (what is drop-dead date for handoffs and resourcing?)
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to ask Max if Aug 6 is ok for AAV luxios? PRADA will need 4 luxios at least until data deadline for board deck
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) ask Max for specific asks/trade-offs related to Opto team working on CLD-first-pass development
*   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to chat about prioritization within CLD/Shahram work in CLD tech lead meeting (related to enabling Opto CLD work).

## **DTPT - Emily**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   Production runs are ongoing - starting phase 2 (intensified process) runs Mon/Tues this week
    *   still using 2 luxios and all tube spin spots for now
    *   doing our best to see if we can wrap up with luxios by June 23 to free up space for PRADA
        *   We hope to be able to shift to just tube spins after the current run (June 9 - 16+), but won't know for certain until we see the data - _any others who want to use these in the coming please talk to DTPT/PRADA_
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) sort out a plan so we know when we can give PRADA info as soon as we have it - they need to know if they can use luxios when needed!
            *   assess whether we can have a linear comparison with a process using other illuminators - if so, free up the luxios
        *   If we decide to do another week or two of plate studies, the team would rather continue using luxios since we're at the tail end of our work and are used to those systems. There also seems to still be uncertainty around availability of other incubators/illuminators currently.
        *   That's our preference, but if we both need resources, we should just huddle with project sponsors and figure out what makes the most sense from the company perspective and do that!
    *   intensified process requires us to temperature shift the full shelf of the infors we are using (this will happen on Wed this week 37→35C) - I shared this on lab-talk, but please let us know if this is an issue! _This might've changed :O_
*   Close collaboration with Analytics
    *   they are helping with Lemon Lime purification/analytics
    *   they are running blinatumomab Octet assays for us
    *   reference samples for Green Apple arriving this Wednesday

## PRADA - Will
*   **Resourcing:**
    *   Temp RA (Jaren) starting this Thurs
*   First run bumped back a week to 6/23 to give more time for training Jaren, target selection
*   **Luxios**
    *   **Calibration:** Aiming for week of 6/16. Ideally 4, but can do 2 if necessary
        *   Why is this necessary? Max power varies by up to 50% within a given plate, 20% across plates
        *   OW1: ![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/e25cc0b5-b301-4728-adae-b9129ec3467a/Screenshot%202025-06-09%20at%202.27.10%E2%80%AFPM.png)
        *   OW5: ![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/9be8ecc0-414a-42af-8357-1da891d54e65/Screenshot%202025-06-09%20at%202.28.25%E2%80%AFPM.png)

*       *   **PRADA Runs:** Hoping to use 4x starting 6/23 (in convo with [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) about this already)

*   PRADA is definitely planning to use 4 Luxios from 6/7 to 8/6. **Will likely include temp shift to 35C on day 3.** Any issue with Incubator space?

*   **ELISAs**
    *   ~~SERPINC1 ELISA kits - I heard that DTPT used some of the stock that PRADA purchased. were more ordered (or were the PRADA kits not used)~~ [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)~~?~~ _~~PRADA kits were not used - ours came in time (ask Maya if you have any trouble locating yours)~~_
    *   Matt will be running the ELISAs for us. What's the best way to get bench space for him to use?
        *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to reach out to John/Cooper about bench space in Mol Bio for ELISAs
    *   Discussion about getting a plate washer for ELISAs - [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to get a quote and share with [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244)
## **Opto chassis - Emily**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
*   Still struggling with challenges of transfection and GS selection in CHOZN-Elite lines - working with CLD on this
*   Moving forward with a subset of opto chassis (others lagging behind) as well as the all-in-one approach
*   confirmed that its okay if PRADA uses luxios until Aug 6 and then hands off to Ed for AAV work
*   AAV work
    *   working with Ed to order 2 more shakers and an absorbance plate reader since our current inventory wasn't working/wasn't available
## **Hardware - Mads**
### Cross Project Relevant Notes
_All dates are approximate._
*   Big Updates
    *   Airtable: Our system for reserving and running illuminators is in Beta (working, but operated by HW team). It is currently operating Arbok (partial fleet), Tentacool, Palkia, and DX2. We are very excited to finish this and perform user trainings because operating the system takes a lot of team time, but for now it is a necessary headache as it reduces risk of a new system breaking. **Please communicate this to your respective teams as we have gotten a lot of questions about this!** DX2 trainings will likely be in a few weeks and Arbok trainings a few weeks after that. Max is the architect of this and works on it when he can. ![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/c61cf1db-1274-45a2-9009-f19c6b78967d/Screenshot%202025-06-10%20at%202.01.17%E2%80%AFPM.png)
    *   Technician Hiring: We are hiring a level 2 or 3 technician. Baxter and I are doing round 2 interviews this week. Onsite interviews will be in 2 weeks (would be next week but Juneteenth holiday = many people out).
    *   **Device Owners have been decided** [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p4NAEQpHV0j_gxEXmpnLeNRd3cmRs0ixB8J1KxsI2yM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fdg591yhmlk3)**. Please remind your teams to give illuminator feedback directly to the device owner (or anyone on the team for that matter).** We've heard through the grapevine that people have issues but we don't get a lot of direct feedback. Normally the issues are covered in manuals or are easy for a DO to fix so communicating issues/feedback will help everyone in the long run.
Illuminator Update:
*   Wellplate illuminator ([DX2](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901109353931)):
    *   2 Devices in house
        *   1 operating Basanta's experiment this week
        *   1 used by hardware team (testing calibration before / after incubator use, incorporating more sensor data, etc)
        *   Needed: 1 user to learn how to operate the DX2 from start to finish and give feedback, likely end of this week or early next week. Please advise if you know a good candidate.
    *   More devices coming: 7 available in a few weeks, and then all 15 available a few weeks after that
        *   Dates are TBD for now, will update when we know.
*   50L Illuminator ([Tentacool](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901107129487)):
    *   Run is underway June 9-13
        *   Lunch area display of will start with illumination on Weds and Thurs
*   Incubator Illuminator (Sp/[Arbok](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110355993)):
    *   Work in progress, lower priority than DX2 and Tentacool, so development is opportunistic. Complete remodel of the infrastructure that runs Sp/Arboks.
    *   Approximately July 10: Users can use all Sp/Arbok without Mads. Some may be available before then.
    *   2 Sparboks in Infors. No concrete plans for another though CLD will probably need one (please let me know when the approximate ideal install date is known)
*   Spin Tube Illuminator ([Spinda](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110136609)):
    *   No concrete delivery yet. ROM estimate = August for usage of first Spinda device.
    *   Baxter will begin work on this soon, DX2 issues delayed by a week or so
*   Optowell (Luxio) Calibration:
    *   Calibration of optowell devices will likely happen next week (June 16 & 17) by Will and I

## CLD Cross project relevant notes
*   **GLP Safety Bank**
    *   For biostrategy: CLD are maintaining a seed train of GLP CHO-E cells over the next few months up to passage 20. We will be splitting on a regular cadence (every 2 days), maintaining a log of passage, DT etc. **1 flask from a split will be available for other teams to use in their work and the other flask will be for CLD to maintain (sticker system to denote).** Mare creating [benchling log (WIP)](about:blank)
    *   Other teams should not access the locked safety bank. If you require lower passage cells speak to Mon/Amritha. - [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) communicate this in biostrategy as well!
*   **Have begun communication with Emily G/opto to confirm:**
    *   Can CLD use 4/15 new DXS2 starting end of July.
    *   This might ramp up to 6 DXS2 in November.
    *   Communication around likely needing 2 Kuhner incubators for CLD work once opto chassis handed off, can opto store their cells elsewhere when not doing GLP?
    *   ~~Need confirmation on when and how many cell lines for the Green Apple Beacon work~~
        *   Answer: 8. Likely cell lines ready 1 week after (but since Beacon will be in use for the all in one humira/herceptin this would mean green apple go on Beacon 2 weeks later).
    *   Amritha might have a v1 Neon transfection protocol for you to try (Makoto is already going to be using it for his transfections).
    *   ~~For the optochassis that didn't work as well, are they going to be re-evaluated (maybe with a new transfection protocol) or are they just being dropped for now?~~
    *   Does opto have capacity to train us on the wolf single cell sorting for clonal outgrowth studies? e
    *   CLD preparing an SOP for opto for all in one fed batch study off beacon. Opto should consider having someone shadow the current fed batch process?
    *   How many clones are you interested in taking off the Beacon for the all in 1 strategy? Consider how many DWBs you will have ~16 \* 24 DWBs if take 24 clones.
        *   1 opto chassis, 2 molecules (Humira/Herceptin), 2 ratio Hc/Lc = 4 opto cell lines into Beacon.
        *   CMV Humira 2 ratios, CMV Herceptin 2 ratios = 4 CMV lines into Beacon
        *   Green Apple 4 CMV lines 4 UAS lines.

*   **Incubator space:**
    *   Ideally CLD has both Kuhners
    *   CLD currently in 1 HeraCell that is in the GLP space, has shaking platform (temp shift possible) - ideally we would put 2 DXS2 in there.
    *    We believe there is another HeraCell that we would also need. (temp shift possible) - ideally we would put 2 more DXS2 in there
        *   `This HeraCell requires purchasing 1 more shaking platforms`  If anyone has the info on the model/cost let me know.
    *   confirming: [@Amritha Menon](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U08KRQ3QZC3) you had a comment about making sure the bottom Kuhner has the adaptors for 24 \* 24DWB. Is that correct? [@Basanta](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U03E1J3SX41) confirming this works with [your plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16d5Pu3MVejdeXnr9rrX9a76okc0sczdMYwg4W2MmYCA/edit?gid=1683882053#gid=1683882053)

*   **Have begun communication with Hardware:**
    *   New CLD plans requires illuminators ~1 month sooner than when we had requested, but fewer overall.
    *   need 2 opto systems ideally starting now for the pools/clones- fed batch evaluation (we have this already - Luxio and testing DXS2 which will be given back to hardware)
    *   From End July it would be great to have 4 DXS2 and 6 DXS2 in Nov.
    *   Proposed 2 DXS2 on shaking platform in HeraCell 1 and 2 DXS2 on shaking platform in Heracell2.
        *   This enables a smaller incubator space to be temp shifted for experiments, leaving the Kuhner for maintenance/experiments non temp shifted.
        *   `Requires Hardware to adapt the Rosetta to be HeraCell compatible $1000 plus mads time. Likely worth it? 1m TAT for external manufacturing, need to get this order in asap for end of July start.`

*       *   Confirming sparbok installation in bottom Kuhner with John as Amritha and Shahram's plans focus on 24DWB.

*   **Plan to discuss in meeting with analytics this week:**
    *   when/to what extent to include PQ studies in the narrowing down of commercializable opto chassis clones - likely also depends on other projects he has going on and the relative priority.
    *   Current estimate from Amritha/Shahram 36-48 clones could be available for PQ studies on 6th Aug and 5th Sept.
    *   Could choose a target that is easiest for analytics.
    *

# Cross Project Relevant Notes
## **DTPT - Emily**
*   2-3 more weeks of tube spin runs (freed up luxios last week!)
*   working heavily with analytics in the coming weeks
*   quality data for SERPINC shows it is unlikely we are making the proper target - further testing planned
## PRADA - Will
*   Production runs started this week w/ 4 Luxios (SERPINC1, GCSF)
*   Selecting 1-2 additional targets tomorrow to begin next week
*   Given quality data for SERPINC1, we are discussing shifting scope of PRADA to incorporate modeling / optimizing quality attributes w/ Kiana and Ian tomorrow
## **Hardware - Mads**
_All dates are approximate._
*   Big Updates
    *   Airtable still in beta - Basanta is pilot user for DX2 and providing us with incredible feedback. We are releasing to many more people this week so the team is mentally preparing for constantly being on call to help.
        *   ![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/899c94de-c925-41bb-a456-ca04f684cb0a/image.png)
    *   Technician Hiring:
        *   2 onsites this week
Illuminator Update:
*   Wellplate illuminator ([DX2](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901109353931)):
    *   9 Devices in house
        *   2 in CLD's care
        *   6 installed in infors (Friday = training)
        *   1 for stationary (?)
    *   6 more boards coming
        *   Dates are TBD for now, will update when we know.
*   50L Illuminator ([Tentacool](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901107129487)):
    *   Run was successful! woohoo
    *   Data deck in progress. will also do retrospective and share lessons learned with PMs
*   Incubator Illuminator (Sp/[Arbok](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110355993)):
    *   Work in progress, lower priority than DX2 and Tentacool, so development is opportunistic. Complete remodel of the infrastructure that runs Sp/Arboks.
    *   Approximately July 10: Users can use all Sp/Arbok without Mads. Some may be available before then.
    *   2 Sparboks in Infors. No concrete plans for another though CLD will probably need one (please let me know when the approximate ideal install date is known)
*   Spin Tube Illuminator ([Spinda](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110136609)):
    *   No concrete delivery yet. ROM estimate = August for usage of first Spinda device.
    *   Simulations in progress to pick a form factor for illumination. Users don't seem to align on what way they use spin tubes.
*   Optowell (Luxio) Calibration:
    *   done! thanks Will

*   We need to decide whether hardware chooses where to put things and bio has to deal with it or bio can designate specific people to be hardware's contact
## CLD - Monique
*   **Inform LT:** Outcome from meeting with Optogenetics is that CLD will transfect mAb IRES reporter construct into chassis as planned, but opto will not transfect in mAb into the chassis (instead focusing on other elements like Hc Lc configuration and copy number). Nb. Opto will still have All - in -one method which is just mAb.
    *   CLD team will integrate a Herceptin construct - aligned with Ian for PQ related to Herceptin - still to be fully aligned is the exact timing of assessments.
    *   some risk that the all in one approach doesn't give the best dataset for the board meeting and then the other dataset that might be available just in time is CLD opto chassis clones with mAb IRES Reporter pools (which won't be as high as mAb alone).
    *   Victor has been informed/consulted already.
    *   
*   **For Emily/Opto:**
    *   v1 fed batch SOP being written up to hand off to Opto.
    *   When will AAV incubator move? It would be great to move it soon so that we can put the other Heracell on the floor and equip it will shaking platform/illumination devices. Or if the top Heracell can be taken then we can just use the one already on the floor (TBD with opto).
    *   Surface staining (Fc) mAb - Makoto has an SOP that would be helpful for John.
    *   Would be helpful to understand opto requirements for illuminators/incubator space post chassis hand off.
        *   Currently CLD planning to use the bottom Khuner for chassis clonal expansion + other DWB assays.
        *   Estimate CLD will use 10-12 DWB for chassis down selection (expansion and stability). + DWB for other assays eg GS selection vector testing = ~15-17 DWB spaces.
        *   Can double stack DWB if we can get spacers from Zoli (exact details TBD depending on opto/hardware).
    *   Make more hoods in TC GLP (at least the 2 closest to GLP area) - bio leads agree with additional hoods - confirming how many.
    *   CLD have a Demeetra Herceptin construct - would this be helpful in generating the IRES reporter construct? - messaged Max about this already in a thread.
    *   [@Monique](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U01U1U9QQ79) Make sure the downselection from 250→ 96-120 clones happens with CLD (we know opto have already considered this - just ensuring top of mind). & Relay we would like all clones on 4th rather than staggered. Ideally priority on clones with FTO. Also GAVPO (we know works well). - meeting booked for this thursday
    *   Please could Noreen let John/Amritha know if they have optimized PEI any more?

*   **Hardware:**
    *   @Mads has been amazing in helping co-ordinate and install the 2 new DXS2s! They are in the bottom Heracell incubator with the shaking platform and new Rosetta.
    *   Heads up on a work order/request coming in for spacers for Kuhner - exact amount TBD (depends on opto requirements for Kuhner) - will allow DWB for CLD and opto to be stacked during chassis down selection. These will be very helpful.
    *   We need to find a home for the next 2 DXS2s (which CLD need to screen the chassis). Likely in the other Heracell - once the AAV Heracell is moved - being confirmed
        *   this could increase to 6 total illumination devices if the screening strategy needs multiple illumination conditions -deciding this in collab with opto to ensure enough units.
        *   2 Lumi plates were bought by Zack/John - arrive in ~ 1 week: You can [track them here](https://www.post.ch/en) with this number: EE729780678CH
        *   
*   **Analytics:**
    *   Aligned with Ian that CLD will use Herceptin-IRES-reporter construct for chassis down selection.
        *   As a back up we have Rituxan IRES reporter - Mon to check with Ian if that would be ok from a PQ perspective?
        *   Answer: ok but the sooner we know the better. Herceptin most likely.
    *   Mon to ask Ian if analytics would be open to collaborating with Arun to help automate ProA purification
        *   Ian open to Arun programming a workflow with sufficient support (from Analytics). Follow up by EOW.
    *   [Rough chassis down selection timeline.](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110904808) - Moves depending on when we receive chassis. (Extent/timing of PQ analysis still being discussed).

*   **Facilities:**
    *   meeting with Cooper about consumables - scheduled - ideally stores have a back up of everything.
    *   Mon helping cooper with -150 clearance - will get a couple areas free asap.
        *   update cooper is currently mapping the inventory but I have offered to help- lets see.

**Communication with Data**
*   Shahram and Matt have been talking about a collab on data involvement in chassis down selection. Matt prepaing a suggestion - meeting next thurs.

## BMGF - Will
*   Working to true up the grant budget as soon as possible - working with Hardware on any expenses from 2025 that are related to BMGF work
## Opto - Emily
*   Request for 1+ additional stationary plate illuminator(s) from the new DX2 fleet
    *   Alex requested one more in the incubator they are already using with old Deoxys. I can coordinate with [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
    *   If Opto can have access to the 7 DXS released this week, they would rather have half of these stationary or have ability to move them back and forth (is there a compromise here that doesn't stretch hardware too much? Are more dexoys that can be used in stationary incubators coming?)
*   Concerns around where the team can do CHO-E GLP work (in terms of incubators, hoods, etc.) to pass muster to go on Beacon or pass off to CLD - _discussion has started in bio-strategy_
    *   Biostrategy should revisit distribution of hood/incubator/instruments now that more teams are doing GLP CHO-E work. Opto would find it helpful to get clarity on what hoods/incubators require cells to be free of animal component exposure, free of antibiotics, non-expiCHO, etc.
*   Some concerns around dark 24 DWP culture space if the middle infors shelves are full of illuminators. Do we have other options for this scale of culture? - _update from Mads: sounds like there will still be room for some (or one?) standard plate holders_
*   Maybe we need a task force similar to what Cooper leads with lab users from different groups where representatives from various teams who actually work in lab can discuss resource/space usage and propose adjustments as things evolve over time. I feel this is getting pretty inefficient going through PMs, Victor, and tech leads who have to bother the scientists/RAs to gather info and sort things out at every step :/
    *   Inform biostrategy team that we need a solution to this (need better incubator/illuminator planning). Offer a proposal to get people's feedback on. Mention this in biostrategy meeting with Mads present. Strategy for making decisions.
*   Upcoming hand off of chassis clones to CLD for target integration
    *   rushing to clone Herceptin plasmid with desired features for CLD work - this is currently the highest risk piece of the handoff
*   Pool hand off planned for EOW for first runs on the Beacon w/ CLD

*   As part of the above, [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) share a proposal in biostrategy for how to better plan for incubator/illuminator usage so hardware can get the answers they need
    *   we need a way to collect current/future resource usage and also a system to make decisions (e.g. where illuminators should go, if we can reserve incubator space, etc.)
*   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) to communicate in biostrategy that teams should not access the locked safety bank of CHO-E cells, but should instead get cells from CLDs seed train
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to work with Opto to define requirements for illuminators/incubator space post chassis hand off. (can CLD keep using bottom Kuhner?)
    *   if they just need the space they are currently using, what is that?
*   Bio leads to finalize plan for changing more hoods to CHO-E only to accommodate increasing amount of GLP CHO-E work
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) share specific locations and stationary vs. shaking request for Opto illuminator needs over the coming weeks/months with [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) ASAP

        *   Alexandra: Infors 96-well shaking (GLP, lower left), deoxy incubators, one 32 C static (GLP), one 37 C static (GLP)
*   Bio leads to finalize plan for changing more hoods to CHO-E only to accommodate increasing amount of GLP CHO-E work - **done?**
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) share specific locations and stationary vs. shaking request for Opto illuminator needs over the coming weeks/months with [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) ASAP - **done (hopefully** **)**

# Cross Project Relevant Notes
## **DTPT - Emily**
*   Wrapping up DTPTv1 w/ Lemon Lime - final production run from July 7-14 and LOTS of AnChem work is ongoing:
    *   finalizing characterization of existing LL samples (semi-intensified, not maximally enriched)
    *   DTPT re-run of LL lines (&IFNbeta) will finish on July 14 and samples will be handed to analytics
    *   Brenna is helping to setup BLI proA SOP for Green Apple target for Opto/SynBio use
    *   slightly lower priority: triaging of internal target samples that we've only tested on ELISA and want to test on SEC (need to wrap up ELISAs and then will meet to discuss with AnChem)
*   Meeting scheduled on Wednesday (July 9) to sort out if phase 2 Lemon Lime work will happen and if so, what form it will take - this is a business, priorities, and resource question!
*   Planning in progress for cell STRIDE (stress/secretory phenotype) work and DTPT v2 (in CHO-E) projects.
    *   we hope to have rough timelines and illuminator/incubator usage info late this week or next week that I can share with [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) and biostrategy team
    *   in the coming month(?) we will discuss plans with analytics (handoffs are quite far off)
*   For [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) - what is the status for migrating all plate illuminator reservations to Airtable? SynBio folks want to reserve something shortly and are flexible which device they use. I'm curious where to point them (gcal vs. airtable)
    *   This is on Max Hu's radar - at earliest next week, but likely a bit later
    *   For now: 4 luxios, 3 lumiplates (? ask Zack/John), 1 MLA-1... those are the well plate illuminators that prolific didn't make but does own.
## PRADA - Will
*   Analytics:
    *   Handing off ~60 samples from our first production run to Ian for G-CSF on-target analysis
    *   Working with Brenna on Octet ProA training today for analysis of relative concentrations for LL targets
        *   PRADA will be using Octet for ~3 full days every other week, starting this week.
            *   usually Mon-Wed
*   Automation:
    *   Brandon working to become independent @ running Tecan to free up Arun's time
    *   Matt working with Arun on ELISA automation
*   Resourcing:
    *   Jaren working towards independence so Brandon can shift time towards BPD in August
*   Process:
    *   Wee're consistently seeing extremely high ammonia production in our cultures (>8mM on day 1). This was also observed by Sasha in semi-intensified DASbox and SF cultures with ExpiCHO/Humira. _Could this be contributing to off-target species production?_
## **Hardware - Mads**
*   Announcements
    *   Technician Hiring: Jenny signed! She will be joining us as a TE2 on July 28th
    *   I am ooo from July 11. Back on July 21.
Illuminator Update:
*   Wellplate illuminator ([DX2](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901109353931)):
    *   15 Devices in house
        *   4 are out getting capacitors switched (including CLD's 2). Great Capacitor Switch will be planned to have minimal impact.
        *   1 is broken
        *   10 are available for users
    *   Make-Up training session Thursday July 10
*   50L Illuminator ([Tentacool](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901107129487)):
    *   Data deck in progress. Lessons learned will be shared with PMs soon.
*   Incubator Illuminator (Sp/[Arbok](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110355993)):
    *   Work in progress, lower priority than DX2 and Tentacool, so development is opportunistic. Complete remodel of the infrastructure that runs Sp/Arboks.
    *   Delayed changeover to the new firmware because of an update needed. Will do when I'm back.
*   Spin Tube Illuminator ([Spinda](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110136609)):
    *   ROM estimate = September (delayed because of DX2 scope increase)
    *   We have decided to illuminate from the side (rather than the bottom)
    *   Current priority compared to DX2 still unclear and development is bottlenecked
*   Optowell (Luxio):
    *   Repaired optowell is back in house. It won't be calibrated / Luxio-ified until after I'm back unless someone really needs it.
## CLD - Monique

*   **Hardware:**
    *   CLD have a break in use of DXS2 until ~ 27th July. Hence the 2 we have can be fixed.
    *   We requested 4 DXS2 for the end of July.. One of Basanta's experiments may overlap with opto chassis downselection, if there is an extra illumination device it would be good to have an additional device at the end of July/Beg Aug.. (dates subject to change as it depends on speed of recovery of pools - it could be that 4 DXS2 is enough if they end up staggered by a few more days). - Let me know what system is best to book on in the meantime.
    *   Need to understand if we have budget constraints in order to set the relative priority of Aerodactyl vs Spinda (Alex working on new costing for Ambr runs).
    *   

*   **Analytics:**
    *   **Recognize this is not official communication but its helpful for me at least to aggregate in 1 place to ensure Analytics forms/Benchling filled in on time****. The experiments coming up that will have samples to be analyzed (dates are approximations and I have reminders in the calendar to give you full details/benchling by at least 2-2.5 weeks before hand off):**

| **Description** | **Prospective date to hand off to analytics (To be confirmed/discussed)** | **Latest date to notify analytics w/ full description of samples by.** | **Request** | **Notes** |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Rituxan-GS selection vectors (pools) | ~30th July | ~14th/16th July 2025 | Titer/intact protein primarily. | I will try to get an estimation of samples/written Benchling for this asap as I know before the board meeting is stretched. |
| CMV Humira/Rituxan top 5-6 clone 14 day fed batch (to compare pool to clone). | ~4th August | ~21st July (aiming for 16-18th July). | Titer/intact protein primarily (if some look good, could look at glycans on subset). |  |
| CMV Herceptin pool fed batch to improve titers | ~13/14th August | ~28th/30th July | Titer/intact protein. |  |
| Opto Glycan POC using CMV Humira (pools) | 8th August | ~July 22nd | titer/intact protein & glycan analysis. |  |
| Opto chassis (clone) down selection using Herceptin (pool) - 1st fed batch from 36-48 chassis clones | ~6th-7th August | ~15-22nd July | titer/intact protein |  |
| Opto chassis (clone) down selection using Herceptin (pool) - 30 day fed batch from 24 chassis clones | ~1st September | Aug 11th-18th |  |  |
| Opto chassis (clone) down selection using Herceptin (pool) - 60 day fed batch from 24 chassis clones | ~30th September | Sep 9-16th |  |  |

*   **Resources on CLD:**
    *   Automation is needing quite some oversight form John/Amritha - ideally need to hire for this position but we are doing what we can.. if we don't have automation we would have to majorly cut down number of clones look at based on Octet- still aiming to do the process with automation.
    *   To help with John's time being taken we have asked if Synbio is available to help with copy number analysis (Kiana offered and is checking with her team).
    *   In general CLD could do with have at least 1 more experienced RA/scientist - the team's progress is slower as most people on the team have never done this before - understand that for this year we are just doing the best we can but **_inevitably we are solving problems at a slower rate than Opto team need._** Hence, if opto team decide to tackle some of the same issues eg. designing vectors/optimizing integration etc, **CLD ask for a close(r) collaboration (we have a meeting this Wednesday for this).**
        *   Mon to open conversation around back-filling automation position since we expect a continued need (if possible, where would this live?)
            *   include Declan, John, Mon in discussion

## BMGF - Will
*   Working to deliver data on light impact on mAb P! before BoD meeting - timing will be tight!
    *   Sample handoff from Sasha to analytical from run 7/16-7/30 (likely handing samples over mid-run)
*   We finally got in touch with someone at Gates Medical Research Institute!! re: getting an MTA in place for MAM01 material.
    *   TBD whether purification development will be needed (but likely need to do ProA purification on Akta prior to analytical characterization)
*   Opto Chassis delays are leading to reduced scope of deliverables
    *   (e.g. Aim 3 data now only in SF, not in BRX)
*   Action: PMs to remind all team leads that they need to put in requests for everything ahead of board meeting ASAP so we have time to prioritize
    *   include description of prioritization in the comments section
## Opto - Emily
*   Thanks to [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) and the hardware team, Opto has now increased their experimental throughput w/ new illuminators! We're in a good spot with 6 static illuminators and 4 shaking and flexibility to move static devices across a few incubators
    *   remaining team members are getting training on DX2s Thursday
*   Opto has CHO-E solosis v2 lines that were previously requested by Nur. When offered, it sounded like Nur didn't need them anymore. Can you confirm, [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   Meeting this Wed (July 9) to confirm timing/scope of Opto chassis round 2 which will impact CLD handoffs, FTO considerations, possible future analytics/BPD handoffs
*   Analytics development of proA BLI SOP for Octet will support Opto Green Apple work
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) remind Ian about timing
*   Need to figure out a plan to thaw, quarantine, expand RCB from Green Apple - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) is in touch with quality team

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   Reinforcing that if experiment requests are not added to the [analytical chemistry sample submission log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JNgcnC93Q6Uu9x4AsF9ZhWSTRe4zQJsUKMUpa_VJTTk/edit?usp=sharing) they are not in the queue, this also means they require a sufficiently documented benchling. We will not be working off other documents/communications.
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to add LL purification item to analytics submission sheet - details to be finalized in meeting tomorrow morning
*   Original SOW for CLD was focused on Adalimumab and Blinatumomab has now transitioned to potentially Adalimumab, Trastuzumab, and Rituxumab. As the decision has not been made on target molecule we are working on methods in parallel making the scope much larger than originally agreed on.
*   We are pushing our methods past what they were designed for and experiencing pain points as with this expanding scope. We will **try** to get information requested, but ideally these are better planned for when projects are initiated. To help mitigate this we ask that we get this information communicated as far in advance as possible.
    *   eg- We required redevelopment of our reversed phase method for characterization of G-CSF to support we had produced the target species and is likely true of other targets in the original DTPT screen
    *   eg- Desire to have Fc, F(ab), F(ab)'2, HC, LC, and mAb for mAb workflows when method was originally only scoped for mAb
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to confirm specific asks for each mAb target and share with [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) and help CLD team triage

# Cross Project Relevant Notes
## **DTPT - Emily**
*   DTPT v1 is nearly complete
    *   recent handoff of IFNbeta and IL-7 samples to AnChem for SEC analysis (might be done or ongoing)
*   No other handoffs planned at this time!
*   Lemon Lime still on hold - Vidar has reached out to their CEO w/ prelim data, but no response so far
    *   we are working under the assumption that no further work will be done for LL ahead of the board meeting (impacts SynBio and AnChem primarily)
*   Planning in progress for cell STRIDE (stress/secretory phenotype) work
    *   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) there has been a delay in updating illuminator requests because plans keep changing, but I doubt we'll deviate much from the current ask
    *   Relating to plans changing...there's been back and forth on whether to do this in both ExpiCHO and CHO-E or just one. This impacts incubator/hood resources since ExpiCHO and CHO-E can't come in contact and this would be the longest running ExpiCHO work (through EOY). Bio-strategy is in touch about this (likely not a CPRM topic, but figured I'd share)
*   Likely decision to absorb DTPT v2 into Opto's current workstream and reduce the scope to just a couple DTPT targets (including Green Apple)
*   Ongoing bio strategy & business discussion over what freed up SynBio resources should work on - will keep hardware, analytics, BPD posted as we sort this out in case it impacts you all!

## BMGF - Will
## Opto - Emily
*   Opto/CLD have enlisted help from BPD (thanks Nur!) to help run (&optimize) tube spin processes with available Opto & CMV pools prior to the board meeting
    *   this involved cell line handoffs from Opto (Makoto)
    *   this required getting hardware setup in BPD incubator (led by Alex/Max/Nur)
    *   parameter/process guidance primarily from CLD and Nur
    *   I hope the above are going smoothly 🤞
*   **Handoffs**
    *   Top 2 OG chassis GavPo clones will be handed off to BMGF **via CLD** for integration of malaria mAb
    *   Handoff round 2 of v1 OG chassis focused on EL222 and Cry2 to CLD - **~Sept 15**
    *   Opto scientists + Max should be adding SEC requests for Herceptin, Humira, Green Apple to analytics sample submission sheet (only a subset of what is run will be passed to AnChem) - ongoing over the next month+
    *   Analytics development of proA BLI SOP for Octet will support Opto Green Apple work (by **end of July**
*   Need to figure out a plan to thaw, quarantine, expand RCB from Green Apple - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) is in touch with quality team - still finalizing this, but we did get testing verification from GA

# **Topics from PM meeting**
*   Discuss challenges with AnChem handoffs
    *   how do we build habits and hold up our end of the bargain as scientists?
    *   how much is our pace of work contributing to these challenges?
    *   Weekly 1:1s as a check-in to make sure everything is on the submission sheet - need to build the habit to make sure this happens by default (also benchling quality)
        *   make it clear there is an expectation on the scientists to do this appropriately
        *   could also review this in group meetings
    *   surface level agreements (SLA) - consequences if samples are not submitted in the appropriate way
        *   clear AnChem boundary that work will be delayed if critical information is not provided ahead of submission
    *   reinforce that AnChem is deploying assays on things they don't have site-lines into - need to provide sufficient information to get high quality data
*   Don't use ASAP for a deadline - provide dates that help AnChem prioritize
*   Make sure bio teams consider implications on AnChem whenever things change
*   **Actions:** [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) and [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) sort out how to communicate this to biostrategy team
*   Discuss creating a reference of capabilities/roadmap for downstream teams to help with alignment between PMs and these teams - **postpone til next time**
*   formalize sign-off for AnChem during project kickoff and OKRs
    *   communicate outwardly that this process may take longer since we are aiming for greater alignment with resource constrained team

# Cross Project Relevant Notes
## **DTPT - Emily**
*   DTPT v1 work is wrapped up
    *   recent investigation of SERPINC challenges didn't yield a clear solution so work is paused - [https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C0801A0F6KF/p1753460154591249](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C0801A0F6KF/p1753460154591249) (slack discussion in #DTPT channel if interested)
*   Lemon Lime work still on hold - Vidar has reached out to their CEO w/ prelim data, but no response so far
    *   we are still working under the assumption that no further work will be done for LL ahead of the board meeting (impacts SynBio and AnChem primarily)
*   Planning in progress for cell STRIDE (stress/secretory phenotype) work, possibly DTPTv2 work
    *   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) there has been a delay in updating SynBio illuminator requests because plans keep changing, but I doubt we'll deviate much from the current ask - **still true! I have planning meetings today about these projects, but until Lonza is/isn't confirmed and the board meeting alignment occurs, things will keep changing**
    *   STRIDE work has 3 arms - IP, Green Apple, Lonza and we are sorting out overlap/resourcing
        *   we expect that all arms occur in CHO-E cells and focus on Humira and/or Green Apple target - relevant to AnChem
## PRADA - Will
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track, but with significant, actively managed risks)
*   **Upcoming Milestones:**
    *   Aug 7: Complete Run 1 (Lemon Lime targets) & begin Octet analysis.
    *   Aug 14: Complete Run 2 (GCSF) & begin final analysis.
    *   Aug 19 (EOD): Final data, graphs, and slides due for board deck submission.
*   **Risks & Mitigations:**
    *   Risk: Extremely tight timeline for final data analysis (Aug 15-19) with zero buffer.
        *   Mitigation: A detailed slide production plan is in place to complete all non-data-dependent work upfront. DRIs for each component are aligned.
    *   Risk: New Dx2 illuminators are generating excess heat, causing temperature/humidity instability in the incubators, which could impact data quality.
        *   Mitigation: The issue has been flagged to the Hardware PM (Mads). We have been able to manage temp by lowering setpoints, but that has led to lower humidity → increased evaporation.
            *   We are actively monitoring the environment and have contacted (Infors) for temp controller tuning advice.
    *   Risk: Will is OOO/remote during the critical final data handoff window (Aug 13-15).
        *   Mitigation: Matt Fay is the designated on-site DRI, and a detailed handoff and communication plan has been documented and shared with the team.
*   **Dependencies & Asks from Other Teams:**
    *   Ask (Hardware Team): Continued partnership from Hardware is needed to diagnose and resolve the Dx2 illuminator heating issue, as incubator stability may impact PRADA's success (and future projects).
    *   Heads-Up (Analytical Team): Brandon & Jaren will require significant time on the Octet instruments between Aug 8th and Aug 12th for Run 1 analysis
        *   Have QC challenges with Octet been solved? Mostly seems to be working
            *   important to store the biosensors properly and to run QC with each run
## **Hardware - Mads**
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track, but with significant, actively managed risks)
*   Announcements
    *   **Jenny has joined us as a TE2!**
    *   **ENTIRE TEAM will be OOO on August 7th for Annual Hardware Offsite. Plan accordingly!**
        *   We may sometimes be available on Slack but will not provide any in-person support.
Illuminator Update (in approximate order of priority):
*   Wellplate illuminator ([DX2](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901109353931)):
    *   [Watergate](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CEPHwV3G80AFySbw_tnbIZ-377k-miBP0i5uxh7yHao/edit?slide=id.g37289dbebd3_0_887#slide=id.g37289dbebd3_0_887): Bad manufacturing practices + High Humidity Environment = Boards fry due to water intrusion
        *   Instead of 15 units, we're promising to support roughly 10-11 so we can have some for backups + solutions experimentation
        *   DX2s should, for now, be stored outside the incubator when not in use.
        *   Robustly fixing this issue is quite complex and taking longer than we hoped, but it is a very high priority.
    *   Thermal Issue: The systems clear heat from the circuit board into the incubator. The incubator doesn't clear heat as fast as we thought. That makes the whole environment warmer.
        *   What is the priority of this? I know it is affecting PRADA and Opto, and there are a variety of solutions being explored.
        *   Our fix: Reduce the efficiency of clearing heat. This means plate evaporation is more likely, but this needs to be a tradeoff. Likely will take a few weeks~month, so other workarounds should also be explored.
*   Incubator Illuminator (Sp/[Arbok](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110355993)):
    *   [Training on August 14:](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C05E2C04PM3/p1754083672849469) Anyone who wants to use Sp/Arbok should attend. Tell your teams!
*   Spin Tube Illuminator ([Spinda](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110136609)):
    *   ROM estimate = October (delayed because of DX2 scope increase)
    *   Progress is extremely slow. Please let me know if there is a near future where a large multitude tubes need to be illuminated, we may need to adjust the bandwidth and slow DX2 progress if Spindas are going to be higher impact
    *   **we need to know: how many spindas should we make** **(aka, how many tubes are you all planning to run at the same time for the rest of the year)**
        *   when we get to 500 mg/L or above, we can get sufficient recovery of protein from DWPs
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) ask teams about predicted spinda/sparbok usage vs. plates
        *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) - tube spins are not in the plan for BMGF/PRADA
    *   STILL NEED A PERSON TO REPRESENT USERS AT THE DEVELOPMENT MEETINGS, #SAD
*   Palkia
    *   Getting a makeover this week (some small hardware changeouts, recalibrations, etc)
    *   Expected to be in regular use to the end of the year.
    *   Bandwidth permitting, we would like to make better or at least more Palkias, but it is opportunistic at this point.
*   [Blastoise](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKVug3fG9iZTKd6pRFRn1aRW6epfbGRKrmsTUxtqH4Q/edit?usp=sharing)
    *   24 well plate illuminator that can deliver high intensity short duration illuminations that enable scale down studies of large scale reactors such as 2k and 20kL.
    *   Planning stage
*   50L Illuminator ([Tentacool](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901107129487)):

## CLD - Monique

*   **Analytics:**
    *   **Recognize this is not official communication but its helpful for me at least to aggregate in 1 place to ensure Analytics forms/Benchling filled in on time****. The experiments coming up that will have samples to be analyzed (dates are approximations and I have reminders in the calendar to give you full details/benchling by at least 2-2.5 weeks before hand off):**

| **Description** | **Prospective date to hand off to analytics (To be confirmed/discussed)** | **Latest date to notify analytics w/ full description of samples by.** | **Request** | **Notes** |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Rituxan-GS selection vectors (pools) | ~30th July | ~14th/16th July 2025 | Titer/intact protein primarily. | I will try to get an estimation of samples/written Benchling for this asap as I know before the board meeting is stretched. |
| CMV Humira/Rituxan top 5-6 clone 14 day fed batch (to compare pool to clone). | ~4th August | ~21st July (aiming for 16-18th July). | Titer/intact protein primarily (if some look good, could look at glycans on subset). |  |
| CMV Herceptin pool fed batch to improve titers | ~13/14th August | ~28th/30th July | Titer/intact protein. |  |
| Opto Glycan POC using CMV Humira (pools) | 8th August | ~July 22nd | titer/intact protein & glycan analysis. |  |
| Opto chassis (clone) down selection using Herceptin (pool) - 1st fed batch from 36-48 chassis clones | ~6th-7th August | ~15-22nd July | titer/intact protein |  |

## BMGF - Will
**Overall status: Yellow (Pivoting after setback, critical deliverable at risk)**
*   **Top priority: delivering KR3.1 data (3x titer improvement in Humira) before Board meeting**
    *   Our team's single highest priority is delivering the Humira dataset for the upcoming board meeting.
    *   After the primary PiggyBac bioreactor run was unsuccessful, so we pivoted to our backup plan: a 7-day shake flask study using the ROSA-targeted cell lines.
    *   **This Thursday is the critical readout day.** We are collaborating closely with Ian and the Analytics team to measure the titer.
    *   This is our key go/no-go decision point: if the light-inducible (UAS) titer is **\>3x the CMV control**, it's a major win for our company OKR, and Ian's team will immediately proceed with the high-priority PQA characterization of the samples.
*   **Critical Risks & Blockers**
    *   **Arbok Failure:** The Arbok illuminator for this high-priority shake flask run failed over the weekend and there was no illumination for 3 days. While it was fixed (Thank you Mads!!!), there's a risk it could have impacted the final data we're getting on Thursday.
    *   **Plate reader down:** The Spectramax plate reader is down. This will halt all MAM01 minipool screening, which is the next phase of the project. We've engaged with Facilities, but this is a critical equipment dependency.
## Opto - Emily
*   Fluorescence plate reader is broken which is impacting Opto's (and other's) ability to collect Valita titer data
*   **Overview of production runs until board meeting - the team is doing their best to reserve space/illuminators thru appropriate channels, but let me know if there are issues!**
    *   Humira/Herceptin clones from [@Emily Hogan](#user_mention#60038825) (already in Analytics table)
    *   Herceptin/Green Apple in OptoChassis from [@Seesha Takagishi](#user_mention#132270788) (already in Analytics table)
    *   Likely not in time:
        *   GreenApple clones
        *   mAb plasmid chain configurations (HL, LH, HLL....)
        *   Overview of all expected data [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Co2sTdAnRqzV97NnGk17QSnZwE-aLIh3uwa1jXk2xg4/edit?slide=id.g37204956e85_0_0#slide=id.g37204956e85_0_0)
*   [@Makoto Lalwani](#user_mention#132003496) [@Zack Harmer](#user_mention#75447684) Measuring Nur's samples on Thursday from her production run
*   **Other Handoffs**
    *   Top 2 OG chassis GavPo clones will be handed off to BMGF **via CLD** for integration of malaria mAb
    *   **Upcoming:** Handoff round 2 of v1 OG chassis focused on EL222 and Cry2 to CLD - **~Sept 15**
    *   **Ongoing:** Opto scientists + Max should be adding SEC requests for Herceptin, Humira, Green Apple to analytics sample submission sheet (only a subset of what is run will be passed to AnChem) - ongoing over the next month+
    *   **Received:** Analytics development of proA BLI SOP for Octet will support Opto Green Apple work (by **end of July-** **Completed****)**
*   Need to figure out a plan to thaw, quarantine, expand RCB from Green Apple - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) is in touch with quality team
    *   we are hoping to do this in a stationary incubator that has a shaking platform, but this isn't the highest priority item so we will wait a bit
*   2 stack of infors for $20k is getting push back

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   With Shahram and Brenna we have drafted a recommendation on characterization through pool→ Clone → clone selection.
    *   Initially stemmed from sense that BLI was busy and required additional investment, but will also be required to balance requests for quality characterization coming to Analytical Chemistry
    *   Ian to set up meeting with stakeholders when I've polished content: John, Amrita, Shahram, Max, Alex, Ian
*   PM and System Operational Qualification is expected in early Sept for our LC-MS, we will also be setting up internal system performance qualification which is likely to result in bandwidth constraints in sept
*   Aligned with CLD that released glycan data ([row 63](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JNgcnC93Q6Uu9x4AsF9ZhWSTRe4zQJsUKMUpa_VJTTk/edit?usp=sharing)) will be approached at intact level as sample availability corresponds with PTO of method owner and we do not currently have cross training on methods, and the ProA method development is lagging

## New Actions
*   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) and [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) sort out how to do change management around AnChem handoffs with biostrategy team and increase accountability
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) and [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) check with Opto, SynBio, and CLD teams about tube spin illuminator needs into the future. Have needs changed? For the first spinda, how many tubes need to be illuminated at once?
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) is lead coordinating repair of the plate reader
*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) and [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) trying to address over-heating challenge in the infors with DX2s present
*   There has been pushback on the request for a new infors. John has taken the lead w/ Victor
*   Beware that PM and System Operational Qualification is expected in early Sept for our LC-MS, we will also be setting up internal system performance qualification which is likely to result in bandwidth constraints in sept
*   Discuss creating a reference of capabilities/roadmap for downstream teams to help with alignment between PMs and these teams - **postpone til next time**

# Cross Project Relevant Notes
## **SynBio - Emily**
**Overall Status:** Green (On track, planning mode)
*   Not much to report since last time
    *   still sorting out details of STRIDE (w/ Lonza, Green Apple, and IP aspects) and DTPTv2
        *   conversations with downstream teams incoming after the board meeting
*   Heads-up to PMs that as we finalize what projects will kick off, we will need to sort out who is PMing what (Esp. with a large customer project likely kicking off)
*   The team reported that the constant alarms from the infors are desensitizing them to alarms in TC and that it is frustrating when working in the lab.
    *   Do we have a timeline for when these alarms will stop going off? PRADA runs are done, but some continued testing is happening. Alarms shouldn't be constant
    *   If it will be a while, can we dedicate more resources to figuring out how to silence the alarms?
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) - check with SynBio if this is still a problem? We don't expect constant alarms in the future and they do serve an important purpose.
## PRADA - Will
**Overall Status:** Green (we have data for the board deck!)
*   **Win:** we got ~60% higher titer for LL-3 with our optimal light pattern than the control pattern that was used in the DTPT project
*   **Risks & Mitigations:**
    *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) collaborating with [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) on testing evaporation and overheating in the infors with 6x DX2s
*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) will post guidance around DXS capacity in the meantime while they are sorting out over-heating issue

## Data - Will
*   **FYI** \- currently interviewing scientists to understand data workflows and governance and identify areas for improvement. More to come!
    *   efficiency of data
    *   compliance
        *   GXP
## **Hardware - Mads**
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track, but with significant, actively managed risks)
*   Announcements (Questions)
    *   Any update on the double stack infors purchase? [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244)
        *   yes to infors, still curious on dx2 or other illuminator needs - [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) to ask incubator avengers
    *   Shake flasks in incubator vs spin flasks like DasBox: What is a higher impact for customer projects (and internal R&D as well) to have an illuminator for first?
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) check with architects to verify that projects don't plan on using shake flasks
            *   also sort out what the scale up stages look like - what happens after spin tubes? When will we need illuminators for the next scale?
            *   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) ask vidar about this as well
    *   Tubes: when should the BPD/CLD sparboks be installed, and has projected demand for a tube-by-tube illuminator changed since last CPAM?
Illuminator Update (in approximate order of priority):
*   Wellplate illuminator ([DX2](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901109353931)):
    *   [Watergate](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C08HKRM6944/p1755546575616839):
        *   ONGOING POLICY: DX2s should, for now, be stored outside the incubator when not in use. → please inform / remind teams :-)
        *   Conformal Coat stress test hopefully done 8/18.
            *   Following few months = taking 2 devices out of service at a time for servicing
            *   Demand has been relatively low (lower than the illuminator request sheet predicts, by a lot!). So, I do not anticipate this being an issue. Please let me know if you anticipate large influx in usage for any teams
        *   Lead times for additional DX2s is still unknown as circuit board order has been quite complex.
    *   Thermal Issue:
        *   Evaporation test results available soon via [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) and I
            *   Figuring out if fans can be 50% unplugged and support acceptable levels of evaporation. If so, users can run 4 devices with no issue based on results of this experiment.
        *   Fan regulating system ordered, when that comes in we will install and test, then deploy if it sufficiently prevents thermal overload. Some development is likely needed so exact deployment timeline = TBD for now
    
*   Incubator Illuminator (Sp/[Arbok](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110355993)):
    *   **Ready to be installed:** 2x sparboks in pilot plant dark area + 1x CLD sparbok
        *   dates are currently unknown, clarity would be fantastic
    
*   Spin Tube Illuminator ([Spinda](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901110136609)):
    *   ROM estimate = October (delayed because of DX2 scope increase)
    *   Progress is extremely slow. Please let me know if there is a near future where a large multitude tubes need to be illuminated, we may need to adjust the bandwidth and slow DX2 progress if Spindas are going to be higher impact
    *   **we need to know: how many spindas should we make** **(aka, how many tubes are you all planning to run at the same time for the rest of the year)**
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) ask teams about predicted spinda/sparbok usage vs. plates
    
*   Palkia
    *   Expected to be in regular use to the end of the year.
    *   Bandwidth permitting, we would like to make better or at least more Palkias, but it is opportunistic at this point.
    
*   [Blastoise](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKVug3fG9iZTKd6pRFRn1aRW6epfbGRKrmsTUxtqH4Q/edit?usp=sharing)
    *   24 well plate illuminator that can deliver high intensity short duration illuminations that enable scale down studies of large scale reactors such as 2k and 20kL.
    *   Planning stage
    

## CLD - Monique
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track (after ~1 month delay due to chassis expansion issues), some resourcing hurdles being navigated)

**See top for handoffs.**
**Cross team notices:**
*   **Training bio team on CLD workflows to ensure similar processes are conducted across company:**
    *   Scheduling an bio-strategy discussion on this topic and creating clear communication on what, why, expectations, time-frame.
    *   CLD suggesting to bring in 1 collaborator across the different groups to work more closely with CLD to learn the process for pools/clones from creation through production validation.
    *   Question from Will: how do we decide who gets trained from each project team?
        *   likely will be more than one in the end; current soft roll out (Nora/John R as priorities)

*   **Resources:**
    *   **CLD TC work:** Amritha is a bit stretched. Mare will be helping with mol bio work under supervision by John or a collaborator (being finalized).
        *   Training bio team members in CLD will have 2 functions (1) upskilling team, 2) support Amritha's workload - especially when multiple rounds of opto chassis coming her way (at beginning of year CLD were only forecasted for GLP chassis engineering for 1 defined optochassis, not downselecting multiple, multiple rounds).
        *   John may need to get more involved in cell culture and may speak to some of the vector working group folks to see if some of the construct generation can be shared. TBD.
    *   **Automation:**
        *   Strong preference from CLD team to somewhat backfill Kelmen - we are working up a proposal for a 6m contractor.
        *   Requests for Arun's time should funnel via John - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) / [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to remind teams about this
        *   We hear Celleca cell counting is not that good, John started but hasn't been able to prioritize helping automate cell counting via another method - but it is on our radar to do - if urgent then might require help.
    *   **Lab infrastructure admin:**
        *   John has mentioned he is still the front person for lab infrastructure stuff - is it possible to have cooper more integrated here? Does it need specialist knowledge? Could it be rotated off John?
            *   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469): meeting with facilities team (including Cooper) and John, Max, and Victor to align on who is accountable for lab Ops duties (ideally just consult technical team for help)
    *   **Potential collab with data team? -TBD**
        *   After board meeting, it would be helpful to get some help setting up an OpenTrons assay for gDNA extraction (current kits are v expensive). _CLD proposed to Matt - following up._

**Technical update with cross team info (for cross-team knowledge):**
*   Opto chassis downselection underway - 12 blocks with 144 clones in duplicates were down-selected and consolidated into 4 blocks (96-clones total). Clones transfected and banked. **Amritha = point person to fill in analytics form. Mon also tracking that this is filled on time.**
*   Currently translating GS/CMV vector findings from Demeetra context into Prolific vector backbone - construct generation phase. **John speaking to vector working group for support**.
*   Interesting light induced PTM data **thanks to Anchem team!** .
*   Shahram also gunning for some ratiometric control POC data by end of year.

## BMGF - Will
**Overall status: Yellow**
*   **Win:** Our key contact at BMGF was very impressed with us after her site visit last week!
*   **3-4 week MAM01 Cell line dev setback:** Incubator decon led to cells being placed in an over-temp incubator, which caused the cells to die. We have to restart MAM01 cell line from transfection
*   **Didn't meet KR3.1 milestone with Humira:** we didn't produce adequate data in ExpiCHO / Humira to provide a direct comparison between CMV and GAVPO (i.e. same parental cell line, same copy number) demonstrating 3X titer improvement.
*   **Still waiting on finalized MTA with Gates MRI for MAM01:** Will need this to do analytical work on MAM01, need to finalize SOW with Analytics for MAM01 analytical method dev.
*   **Handoff:** Ian running glycoform analysis on Humira for Shahram, including samples from BR1043 (from Sasha's last shake flask run)
    *   Ian followed up with Nessa - since we lost CMV comparison, this was deprioritized
## Opto - Emily
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track, some delays, but exciting data coming in)
*   Board meeting sprint wrapping up now with chassis clone production runs with Green Apple and Humira finishing on Aug. 18
    *   handoffs to AnChem hopefully fully sorted! (**Em** and **Seesha** as the contacts)
    *   work will continue at a fast pace after this (GA Beacon clones almost ready for production runs!)
*   **Other Handoffs**
    *   **Upcoming:** Handoff round 2 of v1 OG chassis focused on EL222 and Cry2 to CLD - **~Sept 15**
    *   **Received:** Recently received additional reference material from Green Apple (this can be used by AnChem and the project team)
*   \[on hold for now\] Need to figure out a plan to thaw, quarantine, expand RCB from Green Apple - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) is in touch with quality team
    *   we are hoping to do this in a stationary incubator that has a shaking platform, but this isn't the highest priority item so we will wait a bit
*   Discrepancies between BLI results and HPLC/SEC results so we need to wait for SEC data to decide what we can show in the board meeting
    *   HPLC is correlating better with SEC results
    *   ultimately, we want to show the HPLC titer data if we see consistent results
    *   Opto/Victor to focus on what story we want to tell based on the HPLC data - sharing this is gated by SEC data ESPECIALLY FOR GA!

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   Anchem just received GA's SEC method which varies compared to our current SEC method. We have yet to evaluate their buffer composition into our workflow. Our method suggests LMW shouldering on their standard not observed in their method. All GA data is through our mAb method not their method.
*   Analytical sample submission process will be more strictly enforced after BOD data is complete. Even into this week we are experiencing major gaps in sample handovers.

## New Actions
*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) to post guidance around DXS capacity in the meantime while the over-heating issue is being sorted out
*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) to ask incubator avengers whether we anticipate needing illuminators in the new infors or whether the current need is dark culture space
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) - check with SynBio if regular alarms are still a problem in TC? They should be less frequent now, but may still occur
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) check with architects to verify that projects don't plan on using shake flasks
    *   also sort out what the scale up stages look like - what happens after spin tubes? When will we need illuminators for the next scale? If so, when?
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) / [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to remind teams that requests for Arun's time should funnel via John (do not go through Arun directly) and that his hours will be reducing
*   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469): meeting with facilities team (including Cooper) and John, Max, and Victor to align on who is accountable for lab Ops duties (ideally just consult technical team for help)
*   PMs + Alex to discuss creating a reference of capabilities/roadmap for downstream teams to help with alignment between PMs and these teams **after the board meeting rush**

## Past
*   
# Cross Project Relevant Notes
## **SynBio - Emily**
**Overall Status:** Green (On track, planning mode)
*   Continued challenges finding sufficient dark 24DWP shaking space
    *   Zack/incubator avengers are helping to reserve some spots for SynBio as a stop-gap
    *   New Kuhner will hopefully be here mid-September
*   Several workstreams are moving forward (STRIDE, DTPTv2 prep), but awaiting confirmation about Lonza to fully lock in priorities and timelines
    *   we love STRIDE!
## PRADA - Will
**Overall Status:** Green (complete)
*   Project retrospective meeting completed last week.
*   Matt doing more analysis on collected data to understand how best to structure PRADA experiments going forward (N, duration, samples, etc.)
*   CLD / PRADA pilot discussed earlier today
*   PRADA to take BMGF's place at Sep 18 Biohuddle - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)

## Data - Will
*   Drafted proposal for data infrastructure upgrades for CLD and beyond (awaiting LT approval - next week)
## **Hardware - Mads**
**Overall Status:** High quality, High speed, Low cost.... prioritize 1,2,3 (we're moving toward higher quality outputs, but that is compromising cost and more importantly speed)
*   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) - to discuss (concerns [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) and to some extent [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245))- is it possible for CLD reassess device earmarking? We haven't seen the projected heavy usage on CLD's dx2s and it is going to be hard to justify earmarking a total of 4 since the 2 earmarked devices are seldomly used. We want to avoid misallocation of a scarce resource as opto is using a large volume of devices and could benefit from using CLDs 2 when not in use.
    *   Additionally, should I be interfacing with Amritha about these things (rather than Basanta)?
    *   mads and mon to take this offline (discuss approach to increase in CLD DX2 usage)

*   **Status of Illuminators**
    *   DX2 (well plate illuminator)
        1. **(Notification) Expect access to a total of 10 DX2s (including CLD's two).** Our goal is to have 12 working at any given point, and we are hold 2 spares just in case.
            1. **(Issue) Allocation of bays:** Opening stationary or shaking bays is an ongoing communication challenge. We are thinking of an easy way for users to let us know what they need dynamically.
        2. **(Issue) Thermal overload:** To increase # of devices that can go in an incubator we are developing a fan down-regulator. this is DELAYED. needs to undergo extensive testing.
        3. **(Ongoing workstream) Conformal coating:** We will be taking out ONE to TWO board(s) at a time to add a protective coating to them. This takes a couple days each. We are working around users' schedules.
        
    *   Spinda (spin tube illuminator)
        1. **(Notification) Slight delays** - expect Alpha prototype in late October. Nur will likely use the first Spinda in late October for the purpose of giving feedback to the team so that we can make a beta prototype
        
    *   Arbok (incubator illuminator)
        
        2 Sparboks on standby for install in Pilot Plant.
        
    *   Customer Illuminator
        
        **(Notification)** We are still hoping to figure out the first (non-wellplate) illuminator that will be used for customer experiments (off-site). There are conflicting viewpoints and it isn't clear yet where to allocate resources.
        
    *   Blastoise (24 wp scale down illuminator)
        
        Early stage / POC , late October
        

## CLD - Monique
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track (after ~1.2 month delay due to chassis expansion issues and contamination), some resourcing hurdles being navigated)

*   **Reliable cell counter**
    *   Currently using nucleocounter and cytation - working on understanding reliability.
    *   CLD team members felt it was important to have 2 methods to check reliability. If 1 breaks - no backup.
    *   Vi-Cell industry standard can do 24-96 samples - Ideally invest in this.
    *   Hot topic in BPD as well - some comparisons have been tested with other cell lines (NOVA, nucleocounter)
    *   Company should standardize on a cell counting method - important for handoffs

*   **Resources**
    *   Week of the 15th and 22nd CLD are quite short handed - Basanta brought up that it could be helplful to see if Brandon (who is well trained in plate based assays and has worked with Basanta a lot could help - Basanta will talk to Alex).
        *   Shahram - help in the lab?
    *   Kiana said she will talk to John and Amritha to understand if/ how Nora could help/be trained - given she is less familiar with the plate based assays Amritha thinks this wouldn't address the point above.

**DXS2**
*       *   We had a delay in using the DXS2 due to trouble scaling from 96 to 24 and due to a contamination.
    *   We will begin R1 opto chassis illumination experiments on 17th - Basanta has booked the 2 DXS2 that we currently have ear marked.
        *   It would be great to get 2 more DXS2 available (we have 2 and asked for 4-5 to be available for this period of time). We were planning for these next 2 to be installed in the same panasonic as the most recent sparbok but we could chat with opto/incubator avengers if that is the best place for installment...
        *   In an ideal situation we would use the infors DXS2 for light and Khuner for dark - same rotation. could we trade with Opto for these experiments?
        *   CLD will be running some experiments in collab with data team - end Octish which help with chassis downselection also. Hence we do foresee more heavy use of 4 DXS2

  

*   Could we improve the amount teams talk to each other regarding DXS2s which are ear marked but not currently in use? These short term type of information eg " we aren't using it this week - go for it" is quite easy to predict.
*   If earmarking is not working we could try just doing the reservation system
    *   run the risk of lower priority/easier research using the DXS2 and interrupting larger projects eg. 80 clones being ready but taking longer to cut these clones down cos another experiment was run without consulting others due to no earmarking. The volume of clones we are dealing with means it is really helpful to have some certainty that the devices are available.
    *   Also as long as they are not booked so far in advance as we are running experiments based on previous data sets.

*       *   

## BMGF - Will
**Overall status: Yellow (on track, but with significant delays due to incubator issue)**
*   Re-making MAM01 cell lines; currently under GS selection. Minipool screening starting 9/11
*   Opto has been seeing different behaviors between the 65 & 156 clones than BMGF. This will be discussed in Opto Derisking meeting
*   Can BMGF use the Beacon? How do we do that?
    *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to provide [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) info on what/when is needed. CLD has been running the Beacon
## Opto - Emily
**Overall Status:** Yellow (On track, some delays, but exciting data coming in)
*   Continued challenges, but progress is still being made!
*   Trouble with Beacon exports for one plate from the last run causing delays - this is being dealt with by the appropriate people
*   Handoffs of round2/3 OptoChassis are on schedule
*   It will be great for Opto to learn/build from SOPs CLD is compiling - especially tube spin process and growing out clones since those are processes Opto will continue doing

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   LC-MS PM and OQ is moved to 9/15→9/19- No MS experimentation will happen during this time. There is a scenario where the OQ doesn't pass criteria and requires additional time and this down time could expand
*   Ian out on PTO 10/8→10/22
*   For the subunit control project CLD shared they are pursuing both Epcoritamab (IGG1) and Talquetamab (IGG4). We do not have sufficient bandwidth for two molecules. Aligned with CLD that we will establish assays for Epcoritamab, and evaluate Talquetamab along the way. If Talquetamab does not perform well in methods for Epcoritamab we will not support that target. - **discuss at the next meeting to make sure we're aligned**

*   Hardware → Nur: 1 Alpha-Spinda (Spin tube illuminator) **Mid-Late October**
*   Mon facilitating/Creating SOP framework setup - [if interested in the SOP process that is currently being designed/tested in collaboration with tech leads.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcKnW_H7PG6RJmEOzy4pyNheyrmV92hwAV9YRc8nUjk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.93mwggpld38h) - goal was to set up by Dec but useful beforehand for customer work.

Status:
*   CLD testing framework with 1 SOP - next few days
*   Kiana then testing with 1 SOP
*   Bio collaboratively creating remaining CLD SOPs.

## Past
CLD→ Opto/Zack: **~Sep 8th** 5 ish clones hand off to Zack for identifying Illumination (sensitivity, responsiveness, dark reversion. day of illumination in time for our first fed batch on the **24th Sep - DONE**
Opto → SynBio: handed off Humira clones from GAVPO pools (all-in-one method) to SynBio for STRIDE project - **done**

## CLD - Monique
**Team**
*   Automation hiring proposal
*   CLD RA hiring proposal
*   Team leadership - Victor discussing with relevant members to formalize
    *   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) to schedule this meeting

*   Request from Vidar: [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) export a range of clones off the Beacon to better understand correlation between Beacon indicators and production run titers

**Platform**
*   Noted to follow up with Amritha about Beacon risk mentioned in Opto update- Only 4 pools same molecule
*   Amritha to discuss with Opto/Ian about molecule for R2 chassis downselection (she has begun to do this but not finalized).
*   **Requirements before going on the Beacon (to post to Bio broadly after Amritha takes one more look (but had feedback its helpful to see this now))**
    **Requesting time on the Beacon**
    *   Communication about desire to use Beacon at the start of a project helps 1) allocate FTE time 2) Ensure Beacon consumables available 3) Ensure the assays are fit for purpose - depending on molecule type.
    *   When you are transfecting, communicate to **Shahram and Amritha** estimated timeframe for when cells will be ready to put on the Beacon.
    *   Touch base with **Shahram and Amritha** once pools have recovered
    *   For now, only Amritha and Irfan are trained, but we plan to have at least 1 person from each bio team trained.
    *   We will create a calendar and some way to track consumables for costing (Nb. there is already a #beacon slack channel for easy communication).
    **Requirements for a pool to be put on the Beacon**
    *   Pool is recovered and maintaining above 80% viability for 2-3 passages (~1.5 weeks). Data to be shown to Amritha& Shahram
    *   \[to be finalized with Amritha's comments\] You have conducted a 5-7d batch assay and shared titer data with Shahram & Amritha
    *   You should freeze 2-3 vials of the recovered pool (can happen in parallel to batch assay or Beacon assay).

**Collaboration with Anchem - Ian and I had a session where we hashed out mechanisms to strengthen collab.**
*       *       *   **Visibility across workstreams:** During the CLD weekly meeting, it is useful to review ongoing workstreams to identify any that may impact AnChem (e.g., engineering a new target, fed-batch date changes) - make sure to go over these in updates to Ian.
        *   **Direct communication:** When issues arise, direct communication between groups is encouraged to ensure rapid resolution.
        *   **Impact of pivots:** When Bio pivots occur, it is important to make explicit that AnChem timelines/scope will also shift. Providing context for the pivot (what new information prompted the change) helps clarify priorities and expectations.
        *   **Constructive framing:** To support productive collaboration, feedback should include both what is _not_ possible and also what _is_ possible, outlining clear boundaries and options. Where something cannot be done, it is helpful to share the reason (e.g., equipment limitations).
        *   **Method transparency:** When AnChem develops a new method, there may be inherent limitations. Hosting a session where the AnChem team presents to CLD (covering method design, limitations, and data interpretation) will help ensure shared understanding and appropriate reporting of results.
        *   **Target selection:** When engineering a cell line with a new target or when suggesting additional not yet developed quality assays, AnChem should be involved in the decision process, as there may be limitations on what can be executed in-house.
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) add escalation process if there is an impasse

**PM/Bio team - decide on how to report non core work (eg. ratiometric, PTM)**
*   Some cross funcitonal component (anchem/ commercial).

## Opto - Emily
*   Company FYI! Quintara mislabeled tubes after sequencing them so the Opto team lost weeks-months of time. We are looking into other services, but definitely recommend sending preps back out for sequencing after we receive them to avoid mix-ups like this in the future
*   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) to discuss with Max what feedback to give to Quintara
*   Opto would like to get 1-2 people trained on the Beacon as soon as possible to avoid delays due to personnel limitations
    *   already began discussing with Mon

## Green Apple - Emily
*   Opto would like to re-run Green Apple pools on the Beacon that didn't work well a few weeks back
    *   already began discussing with Mon
*   GA data collaboration: I will schedule time with myself, Kiana, Declan, and Matt next week to discuss a potential collaboration
*   GA de-risking: [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) we are also very curious to get early CLD mAb production results as those come in from the OptoChassis work. If CLD identifies very high producers, we may want to integrate our GA construct into those as a back-up plan
    *   Starting on Sept. 24 and will go for 1-2 weeks - round 1 chassis
*   GA space issue: the team may have to delay runs because there aren't sufficient illuminators/incubators (especially since people are limiting incubators to 2-3 DX2s)- in particular, the GA OptoChassis clone production runs. I will monitor this and let incubator avengers know
    *   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) recommends 3, maybe 4 DX2s can go in the infors, but some users are saying we can't exceed 2. This is contributing to space limitations and I am a bit confused by the discrepancy - when the team runs at 35, 2 is safest (hasn't been specifically tested).

## SynBio - Emily
*   Challenges getting both sufficient shaking dark 24 DWP space and 24 DWP illuminators space! Hopefully the new Kuhner can be utilized in a way that addresses this.
*   The level/frequency of contaminations seems to be a risk to all work. It seems like Coop and co are doing a lot to address this, but I'm curious if others think more can/should be done?
    *   consensus is that we are still getting root cause practices in place - if there are issues after this, then we go nuclear!

## CoS - Emily
*   Helping to keep tabs on new Kuhner arrival/install
    *   checked in with facilities that they are prepped to install right after it arrives - YES! arriving Friday and movers are coming over the weekend. If all goes well Raf will plug it in and get it working on Monday
    *   checked with incubator avengers on whether they know how the space will be used and whether they've purchased accessories and/or communicated any needs to hardware
        *   Zack is checking with teams to make a proposal for this and purchasing accessories in the meantime
        *   likely that we can't set a configuration in stone since process optimization is ongoing and once we know ideal set points this could impact arrangements
    *   Facilities (Pete) making the call of whether the move can happen this weekend or if that poses risk since Cooper is out next week
        *   Bio/hardware may need to help if this does happen over the weekend (especially since Coop will be out)

## Hardware -Mads
### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   **Incubator Units**: The recommendation remains at 37, **3 units per incubator** while fan board testing continues.
*   **Fan Board Testing**: Testing will take place over the next few weeks. The **second of three tests** starts immediately after this meeting. If successful, the solution is expected to roll out by **end of October**.
*   **New Circuit Boards**: **10 new boards** are expected to arrive **late September or early October**. Conversion into DX2s depends on the outcome of **thermal testing**, so no timeline is set yet.

*   **Camel Middle Setup**: Power and data are now installed for DX2s. The **Incubator Avengers** have been notified. Reserving these units would require **removing reservability from up to 3 other spots**—no changes have been requested yet.
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) and [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) to align on moving CLD illuminator bay reservation now that new install is ready
#### Deoxys
*   After thermal DX2 is under control, Deoxys will be moved to new system. Requires some hardware changes. Will be planned further after thermal testing.
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   Oct~November: 1-3 Alpha-1 units available (sets of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
*   ~Feb 2026: Roughly 10 Beta-1 units
#### Sparbok
*   2 installed next week in Pilot Plant. I will be OOO. Nur has been informed of the risks and we are still going through with it.
### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Planning soft start: making reliability and feature improvements to palkias, expanding the fleet. ~EOY deployment
### All Other Things
*   Aerodactyl (Ambr15) seems to be slightly gaining in importance. FYI - if we ever want to make this device "good enough for customer projects"- the hardware team will need extensive user testing (~1 month or so as a ballpark) as we do not have sufficient info about the capabilities and limitations of the device.

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
**Logistics:**
1. PM (performance maintenance) is likely to be delayed, meaning OQ is likely to be delayed. We have flex given current commitments - for LCMS

Current agreed methods that are in development (eg. [method brief is](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4TAkQl6v9JVhxxkpoyBT9eKUQSKIAzTeMNpFzEcG20/edit?usp=sharing) detailed)
1. Epcoritamab heterogeneity- On track for delivery end of Oct

Methods that need to be scoped, and aren't formal agreements-
1. Trastuzumab (Opto/CLD)
    1. Charge variants
    2. Peptide mapping
2. MAM01 (BMGF/CLD?) - to be discussed in Gates meeting this week
    1. SEC
    2. Charge variants
    3. Intact MS
        1. Subunit MS
    4. Released Glycans
    5. BLI
    6. Peptide mapping
*   request for formal timelines for methods on both of these targets!

**Notice:**
*   Trastuzumab and adalimumab are both showing uncharacteristic proteoform distributions comparing to published values and internally run standards. May be sufficient for illustrating expression levels through low resolution tools (eg. ProA HPLC, BLI) but plausible modifications may be more problematic, may not be defensible in publication.
    *   this was raised to Max, Nessa, and John since their cell lines and targets are implicated
*   Update to our mAb SEC method to use the GA SEC mobile phase is still showing peak shouldering on their standard- might be okay for this project
    *   raise this with Gene in next conversations

## Actions:
*   BPD/CLD need to sort out cell banking responsibilities ahead of future bioreactor runs- [@Shahram Misaghi](#user_mention#81541324) / [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)

*   Hardware → BPD: 2 Sparboks (September 22 or 23)
*   Opto→ CLD: Round 3 chassis ~**Nov. 24**
*   get more info on handoffs from process optimization to projects (as well as communication with data)
*   
## Ongoing
*   GA Opto → GA SynBio: when ready, handoff all-in-one and optochassis GA clones to Katie for STRIDE - **over next 2 months**
*   Opto → CLD: ddPCR assay SOP
    *   Mon asked Alexandra to directly co-ordinate with Amritha- understand the breakdown on work finishing up the remaining ddPCRs since nuanced technical decision.
*   BMGF→ CLD Beacon sort top pools for MAMO1 - Date?? When Amritha back?
*   CLD→ Bio: Tube spin SOP (Basanta and Nur) - Sep 15 (early draft available if needed)
    *   Draft received from Nur/ Basanta separately - they need to collaboratively make 1 SOP.
    *   Further collaboration on optimizing Tube Spin SOP via experimentation spoken about - Nur and Zack proposed as experimental leads from managers - waiting on confirmation from Max and Mon will set up first meeting but then leave it to them.
*   Hardware → Nur: 1 Alpha-Spinda (Spin tube illuminator) **Mid-Late October** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
*   Mon facilitating/Creating SOP framework setup - [if interested in the SOP process that is currently being designed/tested in collaboration with tech leads.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hcKnW_H7PG6RJmEOzy4pyNheyrmV92hwAV9YRc8nUjk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.93mwggpld38h) - goal was to set up by Dec but useful beforehand for customer work.

Status:
*   CLD testing framework with 1 SOP - next few days
*   Kiana then testing with 1 SOP
*   Bio collaboratively creating remaining CLD SOPs.

FTO discussion needed in biostrategy

## CLD - Monique
**Team**
*   Automation hiring proposal
*   CLD RA hiring proposal
*   Team leadership - Victor discussing with relevant members to formalize
    *   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) to schedule this meeting

*   Request from Vidar: [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) export a range of clones off the Beacon to better understand correlation between Beacon indicators and production run titers

**Platform**
*   Noted to follow up with Amritha about Beacon risk mentioned in Opto update- Only 4 pools same molecule
*   Amritha to discuss with Opto/Ian about molecule for R2 chassis downselection (she has begun to do this but not finalized).
*   **Requirements before going on the Beacon (to post to Bio broadly after Amritha takes one more look (but had feedback its helpful to see this now))**
    **Requesting time on the Beacon**
    *   Communication about desire to use Beacon at the start of a project helps 1) allocate FTE time 2) Ensure Beacon consumables available 3) Ensure the assays are fit for purpose - depending on molecule type.
    *   When you are transfecting, communicate to **Shahram and Amritha** estimated timeframe for when cells will be ready to put on the Beacon.
    *   Touch base with **Shahram and Amritha** once pools have recovered
    *   For now, only Amritha and Irfan are trained, but we plan to have at least 1 person from each bio team trained.
    *   We will create a calendar and some way to track consumables for costing (Nb. there is already a #beacon slack channel for easy communication).
    **Requirements for a pool to be put on the Beacon**
    *   Pool is recovered and maintaining above 80% viability for 2-3 passages (~1.5 weeks). Data to be shown to Amritha& Shahram
    *   \[to be finalized with Amritha's comments\] You have conducted a 5-7d batch assay and shared titer data with Shahram & Amritha
    *   You should freeze 2-3 vials of the recovered pool (can happen in parallel to batch assay or Beacon assay).

**Collaboration with Anchem - Ian and I had a session where we hashed out mechanisms to strengthen collab.**
*       *       *   **Visibility across workstreams:** During the CLD weekly meeting, it is useful to review ongoing workstreams to identify any that may impact AnChem (e.g., engineering a new target, fed-batch date changes) - make sure to go over these in updates to Ian.
        *   **Direct communication:** When issues arise, direct communication between groups is encouraged to ensure rapid resolution.
        *   **Impact of pivots:** When Bio pivots occur, it is important to make explicit that AnChem timelines/scope will also shift. Providing context for the pivot (what new information prompted the change) helps clarify priorities and expectations.
        *   **Constructive framing:** To support productive collaboration, feedback should include both what is _not_ possible and also what _is_ possible, outlining clear boundaries and options. Where something cannot be done, it is helpful to share the reason (e.g., equipment limitations).
        *   **Method transparency:** When AnChem develops a new method, there may be inherent limitations. Hosting a session where the AnChem team presents to CLD (covering method design, limitations, and data interpretation) will help ensure shared understanding and appropriate reporting of results.
        *   **Target selection:** When engineering a cell line with a new target or when suggesting additional not yet developed quality assays, AnChem should be involved in the decision process, as there may be limitations on what can be executed in-house.
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) add escalation process if there is an impasse

**PM/Bio team - decide on how to report non core work (eg. ratiometric, PTM)**
*   Some cross funcitonal component (anchem/ commercial).

## Opto - Emily
*   Nothing to report for AAV work
*   Opto chassis dev is going as planned - round 2 chassis have been handed to CLD w/ round 3 coming in Nov.
    *   I am coordinating a biostrategy discussion about appropriate priority and scope of opto chassis work given we are less likely to need to provide an FTO cell line to customers in the next 6+ months
*   Concern around new purchasing guidelines - specifically the ask to not use the general bio code. I've reached out to Christina about this
    *   similar in AnChem - buy columns for multiple projects, but can't bill that way
    *   same concern with Beacon
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) include George in thread with Christina

## Green Apple - Emily
*   Change in plan regarding next Beacon run - we are collecting initial data before deciding whether to do another Beacon run (likely won't happen for at least 2-3 weeks)
*   The team is currently screening a large set of GA opto clones (and some CMV) in production runs (coordination for sample handoff to AnChem is ongoing)
*   Kiana and I met with Matt and Declan to align on scope/timing of a data/GA collaboration - this will be a light lift and will occur during light optimization experiments
*   GA space issue: immediate runs are happening as planned, but there are persistent space issues - especially for dark, shaking 24DWPs
*   Resource challenges - Brandon (thank you!) is helping with STRIDE work for the next couple of weeks to keep this project on track

## SynBio - Emily
*   Challenges getting both sufficient shaking dark 24 DWP space and 24 DWP illuminators space! Hopefully the new Kuhner can be utilized in a way that addresses this.
    *   likely 4 weeks until this is up and running - [@George Hosegood](#user_mention#54170414) will talk to Pete about speeding this up
        *   ask team's how worthwhile is this?

## BMGF - Will
*   **MAM01 MTA:**
    *   reference material arriving this week
    *   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) Received reference info about the molecule
    *   Meeting scheduled with Ian and Nessa to determine timelines for method development
*   **Cell line development:**
    *   first functional screen of opto minipools was unsuccessful - barely producing antibody (via BLI). However, CMV lines were successfully producing
    *   Nessa would like to run Beacon for one of our lines - need to coordinate with Amritha / CLD when Nessa back from PTO
        *   I will share guidelines above with Nessa
    *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) **- follow up with Nessa re: vector design**
*   **BPD**
    *   Right now, building foundational knowledge re: CHOZNe.
    *   Determining handoff timing of MAM01 lines

*   check if [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) has shared finalized Beacon guidelines - BMGF will use these
## Data - Will
*   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) - Is there a need for something to be set up in Benchling for handoffs to analytical team?
    *   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) to setup meeting with [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) after getting feedback from users - will sort out what can be integrated in Benchling
*   Waiting for approval from LT to kick off data infrastructure project for CLD - LT was supportive, but needs follow-up?

## Hardware -Mads
### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   **Incubator Units**: The recommendation remains at 37, **3 units per incubator** while fan board testing continues.
*   **Fan Board Testing**: Testing will take place over the next few weeks. The **second of three tests** starts immediately after this meeting. If successful, the solution is expected to roll out by **end of October**.
*   **New Circuit Boards**: **10 new boards** are expected to arrive **late September or early October**. Conversion into DX2s depends on the outcome of **thermal testing**, so no timeline is set yet.

*   **Camel Middle Setup**: Power and data are now installed for DX2s. The **Incubator Avengers** have been notified. Reserving these units would require **removing reservability from up to 3 other spots**—no changes have been requested yet.
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) and [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) to align on moving CLD illuminator bay reservation now that new install is ready
#### Deoxys
*   After thermal DX2 is under control, Deoxys will be moved to new system. Requires some hardware changes. Will be planned further after thermal testing.
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   Oct~November: 1-3 Alpha-1 units available (sets of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
*   ~Feb 2026: Roughly 10 Beta-1 units
#### Sparbok
*   2 installed next week in Pilot Plant. I will be OOO. Nur has been informed of the risks and we are still going through with it.
### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Planning soft start: making reliability and feature improvements to palkias, expanding the fleet. ~EOY deployment
### All Other Things
*   Aerodactyl (Ambr15) seems to be slightly gaining in importance. FYI - if we ever want to make this device "good enough for customer projects"- the hardware team will need extensive user testing (~1 month or so as a ballpark) as we do not have sufficient info about the capabilities and limitations of the device.

*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) discuss DX2s challenges with [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) re: Opto

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   Reminder- Ian OOO 10/8→10/22
*   LC-MS PM and OQ completed successfully
*   Received reference information from MAM01- minimal usable method information but having information about their characterizations gives us something to benchmark on
    *   Cascaded information for SEC, released glycans, and charge variants to Brenna. Timeline for method development in works
    *   Waiting for delivery of reference material of MAM01
    *   BMGF Deliverables and timings (MAM01)-
        *   Titer via BLI with Surrogate SOP- To be run by non-analytical teams (TBD)
        *   SEC suitable for use in CCF for clonal evaluation (TBD)- Iteration on current method
        *   Charge Variants on Purified Material (Scoping- TBD)
        *   Intact and Subunit MS (Scoping- TBD)- Iteration on current method
        *   Released Glycan on Purified Material (Scoping- TBD)- Iteration on current method
*   Charge Variant Method Brief to cover Adalimumab, Trastuzumab, MAM01 in drafting. To be shared with CLD/BMGF for input on method brief
    *   Expected need for Trastuzumab in CLD ~ end of october (maybe delayed?)
*   Drafted standard submission form for SEC/ProA to improve information in sample handovers. Piloting with Makoto/Zack/Em for initial feedback

    *   **Action:** [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) and [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) sync up on next steps
## General Bio
*   
## CLD - Monique
**Team**
*   CLD SRA approved. Ad being put out yesterday/today by Lily.

**Lab**
*   RISK: Khuner water was near empty. Lose clones. - I spoke to Cooper about this and she is setting up a backup person system.
    *   **Action: Mon to follow up with Cooper that the person knows. Talk about in Lab users meeting.**
*   RISK: incubator Space limited already and lots of production optimization experiments being planned. Need to talk to Cooper/Zack/Biostrategy/LT about solution
    *   **Action:** [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) **to link infors shaking platforms:** [**Infors Celltron**](https://infors-ht.com/en/products/incubator-shakers/celltron) **($5600 from Fisher)**
    *   **Action:** [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) **& Cooper & Zack How much more use can we get out of existing incubators with accessories.**
        *   survey of how much static incubator space is needed
*   Amritha mentioned she needed another shaking platform and Basanta mentioned he would help sort that out - he had an idea of what might be available.
*   Basanta working with Amritha and Zack to re-iterate space CLD needs for chassis downselection work since we moved from certain incubators being largely used by CLD to a more integrated user system.
*   Warning: If additional people start using the Integra we might need to up the stock of consumables - let cooper know.
    *   **Action:** ask teams if they will use this
*   Cell counter:
    *   Basanta doing some calibration of Celleca using Trypan blu.
        *   **Action: Victor check in with Shahram on Trypan Blu Celleca.**
    *   had discussion with Vi-Cell Blu company - currently they don't sell/maintain refurbished ones. [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) **to link Vi-Cell Blu notes** \- seemed unlikely to go with this model
    *   Shahram discussing with Chemometec about XM-40 system - they could do a demo in **mid Nov.**
    *   Cytation? **Action: Mon to follow up with Shahram on Cytation.**
    *   **A****ction: Shahram to map the capacity of cell counting - do we need multiple machines**
    *   

**Platform**
**Automation**
*   Basanta and Peyja working on trying to improve some automation protcols - let Basanta/Amritha/Mon know if you have improvements to the automation processes.

*   **Selection optimization:**
*   Basanta recent data on DM Herceptin demonstrates a good intact mass match. Herceptin in Prolific vectors was not showing a good match, [see max message](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/CRGCYFUSK/p1760547234173669)
    *   Testing MSX
    *   Shaking vs Static expansion
    *   Double selection
*   **96WP production optimization** - Mare was doing some of this prior to Zack taking over - tasked them/Basanta with aliging
*   **CMV intron work - likely moving all vector work to the vector working group - currently headed up by Makoto.**
*   **Beacon**
    *   used spare GA clones to develop the process of clonal outgrowth.
    *   MAMO1? Will? - Exported this week and handed to John R

**Chassis downselection - work feeds into Raspberry project**
*   Raspberry project may need to choose clones slightly before we have data from chassis downselection **~mid Nov**
    *   Round 1: PDL 30 production data using BALA Herceptin
    *   Round 2: PDL 0 production data using BALA Herceptin

**Side quests:**
*   **ratiometric -**
*   **PTM**
*   DTRA Grant proposal.

## Opto - Emily
*   I'm continuing to hear about challenges finding 37C 24DWP incubator space - hopefully the new Kuhner will address this, but work will continue to be impacted until then
*   Opto chassis dev is going as planned - round 3 chassis handoff coming in Nov.

## Green Apple - Emily
*   The team is continuing to screen a large set of GA opto clones (and some CMV) in production runs (coordination for sample handoff to AnChem is ongoing)
*   Decision on whether/how to re-engineer GA pools for improved shots on goal will be made by EOW.
    *   this would require incubator space, eventually Beacon time, and then production run space
*   GA space issue: immediate runs are happening as planned, but there are persistent space issues - especially for dark, shaking 24DWPs
    *   general sense that we will need to swap more static incubators for more Kuhner units!

## SynBio - Emily
*   Challenges getting both sufficient shaking dark 24 DWP space and 24 DWP illuminators space! Hopefully the new Kuhner can be utilized in a way that addresses this.
    *   **Action: start recording every delay/issue to quantify impact to projects**
        *   ensure incubator avengers reports out issues

## BMGF - Will
*   From Nessa - Any questions about methods we are using for transfection?
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) / [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to touch base about transfection methods
    *   Would require 1 FTE x 2 months to develop new method
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to contact Natalie about convo with mNeon
*   More minor delays in UAS cell line development - but on track to hand off CMV minipools to Sasha next week when she's back from PTO

## Data - Will
*   Meeting with key SMEs to understand their current Benchling processes. Aligning with needs from Data, Quality

## Hardware -Mads
### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   Thermal Overload = resolved from an engineering perspective
*   DX2 Maintenance week (Oct 28 - Nov 4)
    *   5 devices available to start
    *   rest are getting conformal coating / fans / thermal pad - get re-released as they are updated
    *   **There will be work on the power systems, so incubator use will be interrupted. We are keeping interventions as short as possible, but there may be impacts to experiments. PLEASE PLAN ACCORDINGLY :-)**
*   New DX2s (x9-10) - 2 week longevity test has begun (for one device, 2nd device will be added today or tomorrow)
    *   the continued "wellbeing" of these devices during and after 2 weeks in the incubator is our gateway to releasing more devices
    *   devices will be released in 2 waves (4 devices, 2 weeks later 5 devices)
#### Deoxys
*   After DX2 maintenance week, Deoxys will be moved to new system. Requires some hardware changes. Will be planned further after thermal testing.
*   2 Deoxes are not working now and there is currently no bandwidth to fix them :(
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   November~December: 3 Alpha-1 units available (sets of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
    *   Delayed because DX2 work is taking priority
*   ~Feb 2026: Roughly 10 Beta-1 units - DESCOPED FOR NOW**, unless we can get more resources, we do not plan to work on Spinda-Beta anymore.**
    *   This is a rather large change so please consider the impacts this may have on your projects and let me know.
#### Sparbok

### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Work in progress: Making reliability and feature improvements to palkias, expanding the fleet. ~EOY deployment
    *   Circuit board improvements are in progress

### Scale-Up Illuminator (Blastoise)
*   24 DWP illuminator, high power blue LEDs to mimic at-scale light conditions
*   All circuit boards are in-house now, calibration protocols in development
*   end of November delivery

### All Other Things
*   Aerodactyl (Ambr15) seems to be slightly gaining in importance. FYI - if we ever want to make this device "good enough for customer projects"- the hardware team will need extensive user testing (~1 month or so as a ballpark) as we do not have sufficient info about the capabilities and limitations of the device.

    *   delayed and Sasha will be point person
## General Bio
*   
## CLD - Monique
*   Shahram spoke to team about **importance of following anchem SOPs** (with duplicates for standards). A few items to follow up between Shahram and Ian in CLD Anchem meeting:
    *   Discuss intermediate time point measurements - not for reporting in data channel.
    *   Discuss alignment between Ian and Brenna and process of comms cascade when SOP change.
*   **95% there with the Beacon process ready**: booked time with Amritha to finalize this week.
    *   have a calendar now
    *   Have a sample submission form
    *   have consumable tracking
    *   have an SOP
    *   Have requirements
*   **CMV Intron tests producing Rituxan, pool fed batch data reached 3-4 g/L (ProA HPLC).This was part of our KR.**
    *   next steps are to **confirm with another molecule and also to clonally isolate** to attempt to reach 7g/L clone (the remainder of the KR).
    *   Further intron tests being collated by the vector working group.
*   **Chassis downselection - work feeds into Raspberry project**
    *   R1 PDL30 and R2 PDL 0 fed batch ends ~mid nov.

*   **Tecan 24-24 workflow/SOP being generated**
    *   Basanta running assay dev to create SOP for Tecan 24 well to 24 well transfer - highly requested by teams.
    *   Collected all data and analyzing.
*   **DTRA Transient optogenetic mAb work** - first results in being analyzed

## **CLD Collaborations:**
*   **Data collaboration** \- Light optimization with high titer clones and for PTM (2 sub projects).
*   **Ratiometric -** discussing how much this folds into Raspberry or not.
*   **PTM -** [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) follow up on whether we are doing more work on this.
*   **Vector working group (Makoto lead)**
    \- Testing various GS cassette designs:
    *       *   Transfection this week.
        *   Recovery 3-4 weeks
        *   Production (Beg dec).
    *   Discuss CMV Intron tests.
*   **Production run optimization - work feeds into raspberry**
    *   Team has until ~early Dec for Raspberry production runs.
    *   [Details on production run optimization](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/dc/12h8j1-46851/12h8j1-100671)
        *   **Feed - Basanta**
            *   Start a production run every week, last ~10-14 days. First dataset finishing today.
        *   **Induction - Zack**
            *   testing 3 illumination start days, temp shift and seeding densities.
            *   ~10 day experiments.
            *   incubator limitations means the trade off of just using 1 clone and 1 run to address this question.
        *   **Hydrodynamic band - Zack**
            *   3 combos of shaking speed & throw and 4 different vol in tube spins
            *   ~10 day experiments.
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to show timeline of internal dev once in clickup.
*   **Action:** [@George Hosegood](#user_mention#54170414) to touch base with PMs about shutdown logistics
# Raspberry
*   DNA synthesis & construct generation on-going.
*   [Timeline](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901112039536)
## Opto - Emily
*   AAV timeline is very tight, but still doable
*   OptoChasis round 3 is on schedule for - [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to update mon?
*   incubator space is still a limitation
*   NOVA has been a bottleneck - got permission to use BPD NOVA (thanks [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)!) - would be useful if main TC-users can continue using this going forward or whether they shouldn't count on it
    *   BPD will have priority and bio needs to communicate proactively if they need to use this resources.
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to communicate to CLD about planning if they need to use BPD Nova.
    *   We should figure out who is the owner of the TC Nova. Brandon is a de facto owner - I appreciate that he should lend his expertise to the TC users, but a rep from Bio should own this. It should be a rep that uses the system.
        *   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) follow up in 1:1s to get a heavy user to own this going forward
            *   power user
            *   supply and ordering
            *   maintenance & SOP
## Green Apple - Emily
*   The Octet and NOVA are bottlenecks
    *   NOVA booked 8 AM - 4PM every day with an increase in production runs upcoming
        *   consider whether we need to be running samples as regularly as we are
    *   Update on 10/27 - Octet is back up and running like usual!
## Bio CoS - Emily
*   I'm attempting to collect specific info on impact of limited shaking incubator space - please encourage people to share with me!
*   I am working on a business case for another shaking incubator and a couple additional shaking platforms
*   Individuals have mentioned a number of other pieces of equipment that are bottlenecking TC work (cell counter, NOVA, Octet). Cooper is in touch with me about this and offered to maintain a wish list. What should the general process be for ensuring our physical lab space can support the work we need to get done? Who should own this?
    *   long term - this should be part of the question of whether to start a given project
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) bring [@George Hosegood](#user_mention#54170414) into this effort!

## BMGF - Will
*   We prematurely communicated data from the Octet BLI assay that was still in development for measuring MAM01 concentration using adalimumab as a surrogate. Communication was adjusted when Ian returned.
*   Potential collaboration between BMGF and Data has been floated re: light schedule optimization, closed-loop control. Initial meeting set up for tomorrow.
*   

## Data - Will
*   [SOP Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNoDH9ZOvBbrLdSylLr_cZX2Se9GjUXxc6GGFSi2dlU/edit?gid=248392441#gid=248392441) is now being maintained by [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245). These SOPs are for GLP /customer work only. **Target: V1 of all SOPs in-use by EOY**
    *   We will be consolidating all non-GLP SOPs in a central location for easier accessibility
*   Timeline for SOP / Benchling work is here: 901112282878 ([https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901112282878](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901112282878))
*   We're having a conversation with [@Declan Jones](#user_mention#54153257) and [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) later today to discuss data management philosophy & guidelines that Declan will be rolling out.
    *   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) mentioned bad practices related to copying version-controlled SOPs. Training needed across the company. This will be part of above discussion.
*   Benchling entry review practices discussed with SOP team. These are in parking lot for Biostrategy discussion (likely 2-3 weeks).
    *   Rationale for why we should implement reviews for GLP work below:

[GLP ELN Entries\_ Signatures, Reviews, and Compliance.pdf](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/4ad985fd-4fe2-44d0-a9d7-cfa42faafc98/GLP%20ELN%20Entries_%20Signatures%2C%20Reviews%2C%20and%20Compliance.pdf)

## GMP Illuminator - Will
*   Phase 1 Project charter [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjcEQpJng139nZQQJhqf0e9U5e9KHVUW2zNebo6VqSk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.8d25tb92xi8a) (still in review, but project has been kicked off)
*   Main workstream: defining specifications. Aim is to have first set of specs completed by EOY.
    *   This work is dependent on Blastoise experiments
## Hardware -Mads
### Top Announcements
*   Are there any plans to run illuminators in the new Kuhner? If so, by when?
    *   additionally - does anyone foresee a request to add DX2s or other illuminators to a new location?
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) - make sure Zack sees the above questions
*   [Incident](https://airtable.com/appocB39FRXo826xu/pag94AjZoWiTOTwsD) Tracking: a new system is spinning up and will help us save time on and scale troubleshooting and maintenance. Please look out for further guidance on reporting incidents in the near future.
*   Our work order system is also getting a makeover. More to come in coming weeks.
*   Blastoise Needs:
    *   1 person to run the experiment: 10 day experiment, info [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d9iIVjMjdv_G93F9A3igfR7XoA95i5HJ3DgAqkhk1tU/edit?usp=sharing) (Nov 14-24)
    *   1 Blastoise and 2 DX2s - likely the entirety of GOM or GOM + 2 bays in CAM
        *   It depends - Thermal is still a question
    *   Max Ho. and Kiana are going to discuss this - make sure this gets back to Mads/Max Hu [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)

### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   DX2 Maintenance week (Oct 28 - Nov 4)
    *   **There will be work on the power systems, so incubator use will be interrupted. We are keeping interventions as short as possible, but there may be impacts to experiments.**
        *   GOM = Thurs Oct 30
        *   CMMS 1020 = Mon Nov 3
*   New DX2s (x9-10) - 2 week longevity test is going well!
    *   the continued "wellbeing" of these devices during and after 2 weeks in the incubator is our gateway to releasing more devices
    *   devices will be released in 2 waves (4 devices, 2 weeks later 5 devices)
        *   first wave may be as soon as 2 weeks from now (Nov 11) but this is gated by testing.
#### Deoxys
*   After DX2 maintenance week, Deoxys will be moved to new airtable / controller system. Requires some hardware changes and will involve a user behavior change (reserving deoxys-1s on the new airtable).
*   2 Deoxes are not working now and there is currently no bandwidth to fix them :(
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   November~December: 3 Alpha-1 units available (sets of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
    *   Delayed because DX2 work is taking priority
*   ~Feb 2026: Roughly 10 Beta-1 units - DESCOPED FOR NOW**, unless we can get more resources, we do not plan to work on Spinda-Beta anymore.**
#### Sparbok
### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Work in progress: Making reliability and feature improvements to palkias, expanding the fleet. ~EOY deployment
    *   Circuit board improvements are in progress

### Scale-Up Illuminator (Blastoise)
*   24 DWP illuminator, high power blue LEDs to mimic at-scale light conditions
*   end of November delivery

### All Other Things
*   Aerodactyl (Ambr15) seems to be slightly gaining in importance. FYI - if we ever want to make this device "good enough for customer projects"- the hardware team will need extensive user testing (~1 month or so as a ballpark) as we do not have sufficient info about the capabilities and limitations of the device.

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   Initial transition of charge variant method for mAb targets from volatile buffer to non volatile buffer (both pH and salt) suggested good separation of basic species but improvements are still needed for separation of acidic species. Development delayed ~1 week for focus time for MAM01 released glycans which has more clearly defined timelines.
*   Initial Titer/aggregates/fragments sample form received no feedback from pilot users. Provided to Will for development of a benchling template
*   MAM01 Quant-
    *   BLI- Response for MAM01 and adalimumab compared between two different lots of biosensors with inconsistent response observed(eg. Lot 1- MAM01 always higher response, Lot 2- Adalimumab higher response at some concentrations). High lot to lot variability of biosensor response observed.
    *   ProA HPLC- Initial comparison showed good linearity and more consistent response between adalimumab and MAM01 across the calibration.
    *   Due to resource limitations for MAM01 BLI development we are considering implementing rank ordering method for MAM01 via BLI only
*   We are observing bad practices in Octet use leading to increases in "failed" experiments.

    *   Test them out? Agree on one?
*   Cell counter - being discussed in conjunction with CEDEX
*   CLD experiencing the consequence of being the first team to do long term experiments and the associated risks - CLD will be re-doing their risk assessment next year and will share to inform risks/mitigations for long projects - hopefully help get ahead of some of these issues.
*   Biostrategy on R&D prioritization or Should CLD do a biostrategy on work that CLD team is doing/could be doing/not yet doing to make sure we are on the same page. [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) and [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) meeting next week to discuss.
Work that has been mentioned that it could be worth planning for:
*       *   **Core work CLD members are planned for:**
        *   subunit control
        *   Raspberry
        *   BMGF
        *   Data collab (GLIDE and PTM ... potentially improved clone selection).
*       *   **Work CLD could do:**
        *   some Ambr work?
        *   FUT 8 KO PTM POC..
        *   Further chassis stability characterization with newly developed lines (Meet with Alexandra to understand dev?)
        *   Once we have chosen host chassis - engineer opto PTM enzymes into host.
        *   Beacon dev for subunit control
        *   MCB generation?
*       *   **Other work not planned for:**
        *   inducible KD HCP.
*   onsite interviews for CLD SRA next week.
*   Automation hire going up - 6m contractor
## **CLD Collaborations:**
*   Alex T is collating investment case for glucose/titer debottlenecking - Thank you!
*   Collab with data team on GLIDE (light optimized mAb production) and PTM control ongoing.
*   CLD/Opto working on a dossier for FDA
*   Amritha finishing up Valita titer assay dev - think she mentioned she was getting slightly higher titer, but rank order comparable - Shahram mentioned that CLD will be using valita titer.
*   **Facilities: Advanced fed batch media update**
    *   Merck have an allocation team who are deciding who gets the non QC'd media (trace element differences)
    *   We have requested 10L/month. - can update
    *   The new qualified material is set to release ~April 2026. 
    *   CLD planning to test ActiPro (BPD have tested but different scale).
    *   Action: Growth media.
*   **Facilities: Incubator malfunctions on chassis production run.**
    *   need regular preventative maintenance - schedule ahead of time - communicating with facilities team to plan this. Can book incubators with illuminators for PM but incubators without illuminators currently no booking system?
    *   monitoring system? - Elemental machines warning - believe the sensor was broken on the machine. Raf replacing - lab users to sign up for alerts - cooper will bring up in lab talk.
*   **Hardware: Illuminator failures**
    *   GLIDE illuminator failure and opto chassis downselection illuminator failure
        *   Amritha will train more on swapping DXS2s but she was also thinking that its not that easy for find spare ones - multiple places in lab rather than 1 hub?
        *   Max was wondering if this was an illuminator which was recently serviced? Root cause?
*   **chassis downselection:**
    *   14 day fed batch of R1 R2 stopped at day 8 due to incubator failure/
    *   Amritha re-running humira & MAMO1 double selection in select clones (info for BMGF and Raspberry)
    *   R3 with CLD, passaging, will transfect soon - vector tbc since need to re-transfect R1 and R2, it might make sense to swap molecules.
    *   CLD planning to do post thaw clone validation with multiple molecules.
*   Plan a biostrategy on criteria for MCB - CLD will suggest criteria.
    *   need to discuss with George if worth having an MCB room in house. [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to prep for that discussion.
    *   do we expect we might promote 1 clones from R1-R3? or wait for further chassis dev work? [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) to plan meeting with Max and Alexandra and Emily.
        *   CLD see it a risk that we don't have selection on opto components - Shahram following up with Max if/when to start research - next round of chassis dev?
*   Beacon run planned for:
    *   BMGF
    *   GA
### SOP / Data Infrastructure (Will)
*       *   we have several SOPs finalized (v1, not in standard template)
    *   v2 SOPs will all be transferred into new template
    *   Benchling data infra work has been deprioritized to focus on BMGF, Subunit, GMP Illuminator. Aiming to launch new Benchling templates by end of Feb.
# Raspberry

*   Internal dev:
    *   Production optimization wrapping up.
    *   Thaw top opto chassis clones today. start engineering next week. 2 GAVPO 2 Cry2
        *   Holiday cover still TBC- max speaking to team
    *   Chance to re-engineer just before xmas since first chassis downselection data only got up to day 7 due to incubator failure. Amritha trying to resuscitate clones and will re-run fed batch if they survive.
    *   Recent opto/anchem data on a production run confusing with the same sample giving measurements of 7g/L, 10g/L and 12g/L - maybe storage of sample impacted - Ian following up.
        *   Discussion ongoing with whether it is ok to report the most conservative titer or whether all data can not be reported due to QC concerns.
*   CMV Humira Opto [BLIMP Puro production run did not observe titer increase](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VSJLaXU9egQ3cRaThrWswJZ9iNCwhOk4xq7MoVV4fUI/edit?slide=id.g3a4481a8a98_0_8#slide=id.g3a4481a8a98_0_8) -troubleshooting ongoing. 
*   Sorted mini pools expressing BLIMP were overtaken by non expressing cells - re-sorting minipools more stringently and clonally, plus additional antibiotic selection strategy.  
*   
## Opto - Emily
*   See Bio CoS section for equipment limitations
*   Final Optochassis handoff (for now) passed to CLD around Nov. 14
*   Challenges due to MolBio lab being so cold (~17C) - reagents are precipitating and RT cultures grow very slowly extending timelines
    *   I sent a message to Pete/Raf to inquire about this and they are doing their best to maintain the lab at 20-22C
*   Challenges with new DX2 malfunctioning - hardware is addressing this
## Green Apple - Emily
*   Poor cross-team communication led to GA reference stock being nearly depleted without me/Kiana knowing. This has been discussed with the most relevant people, but everyone please encourage teams to communicate with project leads about using valuable reference material!
*   Inconsistencies in BLI process across groups that have collected GA data
    *   Short term interpretation was addressed across bio/AnChem...
*   Current priorities through the end of the year include:
    *   data team collab production run to optimize illumination conditions
    *   re-engineering pools based on our latest learnings to go on the Beacon mid Dec!
*   STRIDE work most likely delayed until the new year
## Bio CoS - Emily
*   **The Octet and NOVA are current bottlenecks**
    *   NOVA booked 8 AM - 4PM certain days with an increase in production runs upcoming
        *   confirmed that team need to run samples as often as they are since most groups are working on process optimization right now for various targets
        *   helpful input from [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) and [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) w/ suggestions to use a glucose analyzer or YSI2500 if we teams need to test just glucose or glucose/lactate
        *   can we assign a point person to determine the specific need here and make a proposal for how to proceed (purchasing new equipment, better triaging, etc.)
    *   octet is very busy as well - Are [@Shahram Misaghi](#user_mention#81541324) and [@Amritha Menon](#user_mention#81541323) able to own this and sort out what we should be pursuing to increase our titer screening throughput? - I know Valita has been suggested
*   **Request for an additional shaking incubator is approved** \- **This is extra critical given that one of our infors has malfunctioned is broken/unreliable.** unfortunately the Kuhner we had our eyes on was sold. [@Alyssa Cooper](#user_mention#126060289) is helping monitor used sites with the aim of getting something by late Dec/early Jan.
    *   thanks everyone for input in making this business case!
*   Challenges with sensors in incubators as well - teams would like to be able to respond quickly to salvage experiments - Raf is replacing broken sensor
    *   option for people to sign up to get elemental machines alerts!
*   [@George Hosegood](#user_mention#54170414) will make sure that Pete follows up about sensors in incubators, fridges, freezers
    *   add check to purchasing process to ensure new equipment is compatible with alarm systems
## high mAb titer project - Emily
*   project is being formalized - mini project update coming soon
*   Alex will oversee umbrella project that includes CLD and BPD efforts
    *   Emily is the PM
    *   Max Ho. will lead the CLD portion (including ongoing work)

## BMGF - Will
*   Met with BioStrategy earlier today to discuss technical strategy after changing host line
*   Keeping same timeline, proceeding at risk
*   **Key Milestone: 1/12/26 – target handoff date of opto-inducible cell line – will determine whether to extend timeline into mid-May**
*   Resourcing
    *   Need to ensure we're getting 50% of Basanta's time
    *   To pursue additional vector strategy, we need help from Makoto or Noreen - 10-20% for ~2 weeks.
*   Handoffs:
    *   Issues with BLIMP may cause delays in Aim 2
    *   Cry2oligo cell line - Nessa initiated discussion in slack channel
## Subunit Control - Will
*   Project kicked off with core team - Shahram (tech lead), Noreen (50% now, 100% in Jan), Amritha (~25% starting in Jan), CLD RA (~75%)
    *   Need official sign-off on resourcing from leads
*   Great convo with Cinnamon last week: No in-house analytical method dev needed!
    *   They will share methods for SDS-PAGE
*   Work on vectors for internal patent is underway
*   Raspberry multispecific work on hold until after POC1

## GMP Illuminator - Will
*   [@Max Huisman](#user_mention#54118042) Meeting with Opto team to determine Opto specs required for GMP Illuminator
*   **Key external contact profile identified: GMP CDMO experience, but not at one of our customers. We need help finding this person.**
    *   Quality or leadership positions - onboarded new equipment/qualified new systems
    *   From George: Rahul - ex CTO of resilience who is setting up CDMOs in India
    *   **Action:** share leads with [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245)
*   First Blastoise run will be completed this week
## Hardware -Mads
### Top Announcements
*   There will be a separate service team and development team, as the current setup actively prevents development teams from working effectively by pulling them unexpectedly and suddenly into fleet service work. There will also be a separate request form and incident form instead of the current unified work order form.
*   The hardware team continues to receive conflicting and limited information about the relative importance and timelines regarding illumination in tubes, ambr-15, and 2L. **Request for clarity: is there an upcoming milestone, such as the company OKR freeze or a subsequent plan freeze, where it will become more clear what the company (and customers) will need first?**
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) make sure we come to a conclusion about future of Ambr within biostrategy next week
    *   [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) help sort out what is most critical path for dev and scale-up related to Altrubio/Lonza - how important is 2L?
    *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) send Alex info on shaking plate request

### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   Spontaneous restarts caused by voltage dropping (unstable voltage) has suddenly and whole-heartedly plagued the fleet. We have seen 4 confirmed restarts and 1 suspected restart, across 3 different incubators, all within the last ~2 weeks. The team suspects EMI or ESD aka electricity levels are fluctuating. Top Priority to Fix This
    *   7 of 10 DX2s are released. The last 3 have not been built. Right now the DX2 # is not the limiting factor in usage. Usually the limiting factor is incubator space with the "correct" conditions for someone to use.
        *   Will there be surges in DX2 use such that the number of DX2s rather than the incubators will be the limiting factor? When is this predicted?
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) communicate with Mads when we are ~1-2 weeks out from having a new incubator (make sure DXS will be needed)
#### Deoxys
*   Deoxys is on the new system now! Please let me know if you have any questions.
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   December: 1 Alpha unit available (set of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
    *   Delayed because DX2 work is taking priority
    *   Sasha to run first Spinda test ~Dec 11. 3 spin tubes w/ cells. Comparison to sparbok. Gating when next 2 Alphas are deployed (Jan estimated)
*   Roughly 10 Beta-1 units - DESCOPED FOR NOW**, unless we can get more resources, we do not plan to work on Spinda-Beta anymore.**
#### Sparbok
*   Sparbok AB15 has been moved to GOM and can now be reserved under "GOML"
*   CAM1 and CAM2 Sparboks will be renamed to CAML and CAMR when they are no longer in use.
### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Work in progress: Making reliability and feature improvements to Palkias, expanding the fleet. ~EOY deployment. Initial batch of test circuit boards are in testing / firmware development. Enclosure is in development.
    *   This is likely to be moved because of delays in the need for Palkias
### Scale-Up Illuminator (Blastoise)
*   24 DWP illuminator, high power blue LEDs to mimic at-scale light conditions → Critical "Proof of Concept" for GMP Illuminator
*   Experiment 1 = Nov 14 - 24th
    *   Final endpoint analysis to be finished up today.

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   Analytical chemistry will be shut down between 12/20→1/5
*   We will not accept samples after 12/15 and will stop running the 9am on 12/18 to allow us to summarize and report data and complete end of year maintenance/lab cleanup
*   Current demand is beyond what we are able to deliver in a timely manner, we expect data TAT to meaningfully increase likely through January (potentially beyond)
*   I'd find it very helpful to get requests prioritized so that we can work with experimenters and manage expectations for TAT and prioritize the most impactful work.
    *   Down selecting also helps!
*   We have observed that repeat runs of the same samples can report up to 70% higher ProA response with high instrument stability. In these samples we have been provided materials containing highly variable physical particulate. The root cause of these discrepancy isn't known at this point but if we caution release of proA HPLC data that is the context.
    *   **Action:** concerted effort after the break to better understand root cause of sample instability [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731)

From [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) (via biostrategy)

**Tentative bio prioritization list**
[@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) - add items from submission sheet that are missing (124 onward)
\*within each line item, there is likely room for triaging and running fewer samples than included on the submission sheet. We can dig more into this if useful
**Data desired for the board meeting (Dec. 11):**
Re-run of **131/132** Opto chassis - TBD
**Action:** [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561) [@Amritha Menon](#user_mention#81541323) sort out what info we'd want from this run and when
**137 -** Raspberry/High titer process optimization on 2-3 + screening super-transfected pool (12/5 → fast turnaround allows for 1 more iteration this year) → Qp goals
**138 -** SEC on a subset of the above samples
**135 -** clones screen w/ different Humira chain configurations (on par w/ 2-3) for high titer goal (11/28)
**136 -** SEC on 4-5 of the above (11/28)

**After board meeting:**
**125** \[MAM01-DB001\] Intact (+glycans), charge variant for minipool and process condition downselection
**139 -** GA SEC data for illumination optimization run - want to get to customer by EOY if possible (12/15)

**Early 2026 OK (or opportunistically before then)**
**124 -** GLIDE run 1 (11/24)
**140 -** testing pools with different GS cassettes (less urgent) (12/15)
**141 -** finalizing Raspberry process optimization (if we get #137 data back) (12/15)
**142 -** GLIDE run 2 - illumination for mAbs (12/15)
**143 -** PTM light control run (12/11)

**Still need to be sorted:**
**127-128** - Blastoise samples - second run (12/5) - **check with Max Hu -** [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) to check with Max
**129 -** titer humira samples (TPP optimization) (11/21) - from Zack
**133 - 134** Rituxin and Humira HPLC/SEC (11/21) - from Mare

# 20251209

**Meeting Intent:** Stand-up on cross-functional team needs (INCLUDING HANDOFFS), cross-project risks, priorities.

**Decision Rights (note: this may become Discussion Topics due to Bio/PM alignment on decision making authority)**
*   Plan adjustments
*   Addressing conflicts across projects
*   Prioritization of use of physical resources across projects
*   Risk management strategies

## Commercial check-in
*   update from [@Vidar van der Meijden](#user_mention#54091421) on priority shifts after recent BMGF, GA, and Raspberry meetings
    *   productive meeting with GA - updated timelines and target (1.5 g/L at 80% monomer - strong argument to switch)
        *   phase 3 starting mid 2029
        *   very interested in talking to CDMOs
        *   session to walk through value with Gene tomorrow - could change goalposts
    *   Lonza discussions continuing - coordinating a meeting in BEND
        *   most likely first place for GMP validation
    *   Lots of other ongoing customer meetings that are promising
        *   Sanofi AAV and Sf9 (big hurdles) are most advanced
        *   engagements from Sanofi is stronger at the moment compared to Wuxi

# Handoffs
**Advanced fed batch production media update:**
*   received PO sending to Merck for powdered media.
    *   Making media in BPD room.
        *   1 member from BPD (James?)
        *   1 member from Bio ( Mare/Shahram)
        *   100L powder, make in 10L batches. Aliquot to 1L.
    *   CLD will run a test of liquid vs powder media - could be at the beginning of the new year.
    *   Basanta had some thoughts, told him to follow up with Pete.
*   Received 2L from Sasha - needs to last until we have tested the new powder media. I.e. any production runs that happen the rest of this year and the first 2-3 weeks of next year.
    *   CLD
        *   500ml for 3 beacon runs.
        *   30ml liquid media to test vs powder media. (Mare could cover the 30). Fed batch run.
    *   Raspberry
        *   ~50 plates worth. 250ml - being confirmed by Zack.
    *   BMGF
        *   covered with Sasha's media stock.
    *   GA
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to align with GA on media needs
        *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) figure out what needs to be done if needs to be GLP.
    *   ALSO WORRIES ABOUT GROWTH MEDIA STOCK FROM MERCK
        *   stockpile liquid media and contact Merck about how we mitigate this
    *   [@Shahram Misaghi](#user_mention#81541324) & [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) identify alternatives for both growth and fed batch medias so we have a backup option (ActiPro for fed batch)
**Likely a growth media stock issue coming as** that was also on the list of media that could be affected - make sure Cooper is aware?

## Upcoming
*   **CLD → BMGF: Cry2oligo cell line (after current screen)**
    *   **MH: When is this expected?**
*   CLD → BMGF: CHOZN Elite WT cell line (done)
*   STRIDE → BMGF: \[FILL IN\] (TBD)
## Ongoing
*   Hardware → Sasha: 1 Alpha-Spinda (Spin tube illuminator) (Mid) **December** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
## CLD - Monique
*   Valita titer test - got cut short due to the incubator failure- Amritha and Mare are re-doing. Get different titer readouts from Valita and Octet, but confirming if ranking is the same.
*   Opto chassis downselection:
    *   R1-R2 FB repeat is underway with a subset of recovered clones ( GAVPO-22, Cry2o-24). At D5.
    *   will continue stability passaging for the subset of R1, R2 clones thawed ( total of 15- 6 GAVPO, 9 Cry2o)
    *   R3 passaging of 80+ clones. Amritha to transfect by Dec19th, R3 clones with mScarletIRESHER2. ( Humira version is unavailable ).
    *   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) do you feel equipped with the issues we have had on chassis downselection:
        *   learning new cell line how to expand 96 → 24 wp.
        *   Team less well trained initially (when Amritha was out and couldnt do all passaging).
        *   **no backup shaking space - leads to weeks on delay each time.**
        *   **Incubator/illuminator failure, sensor broken.**
    *   CLD SRA hiring ongoing - likely not going to hire in SRA rather RA since people don't have direct CLD experience.

## **CLD Collaborations:**
*   Action: [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) Communicate to Max - Need for CMV Bala Herceptin HLL (equivalent to c8-H-132-UBC-Cry2) for dossier.
*   Collab with BMGF:
    *   MAMO-1 pools ( in top 3 GAVPO and 9 Cry2o opto hosts) were transfected. Selection starts today ( 78 pools).
    *   MAMO1 Beacon ongoing, exporting today and tomorrow (6 pools, 192 exported clones).
    *   
*   Collab with GA:
    *   Production run testing seeding density (0.5M and 3M), effect of additives and production media (FB and AP) using 6 GA clones (4 UAS and 2 CMV). D6 today.
    *   GA Beacon starting this week on Thursday - Irfan to confirm with Emily/Kiana that it's on track.
*   Blastoise R1 and R2 complete, 1 more follow up experiment?
*   PTM collab ongoing
*   High titer project - be aware CLD have Beacon clones from CMV intron cell lines which Mare is screening
*   Good to understand the outcome of Alexandra's chassis transient transfection - Shahram is interested in staining these - align within biostrategy on the utility of the assay as have heard differing opinions.
*   General concern from Amritha about space - projects going clonal at the same time - we have a booking system for illuminated incubators but not non illuminated incubators - discussed with Max team leads talk about their plans to go clonal at biostrategy - do we need an visualisation of when teams plan to go clonal for planning? Not booking space but but visualizing the space a bit more?
# Raspberry
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) I spoke to max about basanta's time - likely until first production run do need him still then hopefully cut down. Max will follow up with Nessa.
*   Action: Mon to link Shahram and Max up to discuss the details of the double selection.
*   Planning 2 GAVPO 2 Cry2 engineered since have lots of different pools (due to scope and GS variants) - mitigating with chassis pool version GAVPO and Cry2.
*   ~100 pools over xmas.
    *   Transfection dates: 9th,12th,16th. Still time to repeat by 19th, 22nd.
*   Beacon booking clash with BMGF Jan 9th , we booked the next two weeks - if 9th becomes available let us know.
*   Getting help from Alexandra and John on the STRIDE related work - due to patent deadline.
## Opto - Emily
*   AAV patent sprint through EOY
*   Further opto chassis work, multuplexing PoC, FTO etc are being discussed in workstream/resourcing exercises for 2026
*   Some challenges with the latest gen. of illuminators - hardware is aware and addressing this
## Green Apple - Emily
*   Exciting on-site visit with Gene (CTO of GA)
*   GA is the second highest (or tied for highest) priority at the company right now
*   [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) and I are working on proposals for how to beef up resources to maximize our chance of reaching 1.5 g/L titers by mid 2026 (work will almost certainly extend beyond the original March "due date")
    *   once we get more info about milestones and timelines from BD, we will schedule convos with AnChem and BPD to discuss impact of changes in priority/scope
*   **Data:** Ongoing collaboration run with the data team
    *   Some challenges with the latest gen. of illuminators - hardware is aware and addressing this
*   **CLD:** Pools will go on the Beacon this Friday!
## Bio CoS - Emily
*   Latest from [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) on purchasing - in case it isn't in anyone else's update:
    *   Decision to defer ViCell and purchase CEDEX (used), additional Kuhner (used), and 2 additional shakers (new)
        *   CEDEX/shakers approved on Dec. 8
        *   Kuhner will be ready to ship in 2-3 weeks
        *   Massive thanks to [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) [@Pete czerpak](#user_mention#75430545) Cooper and many others who helped push these orders across the line!
        *   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) to send Mads info about shakers that we've purchased (determine if these need illuminators)
        *   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) and [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) to sort out a plan for change management to CEDEX (from BLI) for routine titer measurements
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) is working with CLD to get a better picture of the appropriate equilibrium amount of shaking space requires for our processes to understand if we need even more shaking incubator space as additional projects progress
## high mAb titer project - Emily
*   technical plan for 2026 will be shared in biostrategy meeting on 12/16
*   Ongoing BPD and Opto production runs that may increase our best Opto titers before EOY
*   had a productive meeting about requirements w/ AnChem, BPD, Bio last week - Private ([https://app.clickup.com/36217409/docs/12h8j1-49311/12h8j1-116151](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/docs/12h8j1-49311/12h8j1-116151))
## BMGF - Will
*   Prolific Vector backbone strategy
    *   We reviewed vector designs with Makoto and Max - determined that there was a low likelihood that our low titers in light-inducible runs were due to the vector backbone we were using. Basanta is running a transient expression comparison study with our vectors and the opto ones (with Humira and MAM01). If this shows a big titer boost for the opto vectors, we'll proceed with cloning MAM01 into that vector backbone
    *   Aim #2 goal largely living within other teams for now
    *   Aim #3 work is lower priority right now (until Aim #1 is passed off to BPD)
    *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) Explore opportunities for starting Aim 2 & 3 cell line development work earlier

## Subunit Control - Will
*   **Need to determine when we need methods ready for Epcoritamab (for patent) and Raspberry bispecific -** [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) driving these discussions
*   Presenting technical strategy next week in biostrategy
*   Patent:
    *   we have almost all of the preps in hand for the Epcoritamab constructs. Transfection TBD
*   **Cinnamon:**
    *   Waiting to hear back from Cinnamon on terms of agreement and feedback on latest rev of SOW. **Hoping to finalize next week.**
*   Raspberry: on hold until POC1
## GMP Illuminator - Will
*   Aligned with Victor and Max Hoerner on requirement for resourcing bio experiments in 2026 that will inform GMP Illuminator design: most likely 0.5-1 FTE, to be evaluated monthly.
    *   We'll get more detail based on scoping discussions in collaboration with Opto
*   [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) to start a "Scale-Up Program" to help drive cross-functional collaboration related to scale-up / productization of our cell line, process, and hardware (e.g. driving for answers to questions like "will our customers need to culture their seed train under green light?")
## Hardware -Mads
### Top Announcements
*   Hardware team: Limited staff starting 12/18 until 1/5. Please plan accordingly.
    *   Only Zoli will be in on 1/2!
*   Illuminator Hub Charter: Has anyone reviewed this yet? Is there feedback / discussion points?
    *   [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) review the illuminator hub charter.
*   The hardware team continues to receive conflicting and limited information about the relative importance and timelines regarding illumination in tubes, ambr-15, and 2L. **Request for clarity on timeline and severity of need from teams.**
*   New Firmware update may be released in the next few days. It essentially depends on whether Declan can implement a change to the Ganymede backend. no impact expected but we'll be on alert
*   Hiring for 2 new positions - on site visits in January
*   [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065) work with Taylor to share messaging around blastoise bleed through with really high intensities (bio channel)
### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   Spontaneous restarts caused by voltage dropping (unstable voltage) has suddenly and whole-heartedly plagued the fleet. Top Priority to Fix This . Mitigation strategy is in place and appears to be effective so far!
*   New Kuhner incoming = team will work on all the items to get this ready including 3 new DX2s.
*   What is the current plan for how temperature shifts will be handled in incubators?
    *   need to know if there's a change in how the space is managed (e.g. different incubators for diff temperatures)
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   December: 1 Alpha unit available (set of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
    *   Delayed because DX2 work is taking priority
    *   Sasha to run first Spinda test ~Dec 11. 3 spin tubes w/ cells. Comparison to sparbok. Gating when next 2 Alphas are deployed (Jan estimated)
    *   If this Alpha test doesn't happen, we are going to table Spinda until we have more resources.
*   Roughly 10 Beta-1 units - DESCOPED FOR NOW**, unless we can get more resources, we do not plan to work on Spinda-Beta anymore.**
#### Sparbok
*   
### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Circuit board order will be made soon for next generation Palkias (needed end of January)
### Scale-Up Illuminator (Blastoise)
*   Initial data shows bleedthrough between wells (highest light levels next to lowest light levels) - this is likely because we use grey plates instead of black plates. This may be important in certain circumstances (if a plate plan is being made with high intensity wells next to dark wells, there may be bleedthrough) - this is qual not quant at this point .

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   Friendly reminder-
    *   Shut down between 12/20→1/5
    *   Last day of sample handover 12/15
*   We've scheduled runs through the end of the year (thanks for prioritizations!)
    *   As long as we do not encounter any major setbacks data prioritized before BOD and EOY should be delivered
        *   Exception being Re-run of 131/132 Opto chassis - Last I heard from Amritha harvest is 12/18
    *   We'll carryover ~10-12 experiments based on current requests
*   Recent SEC data from our MAM01 runs indicates that we need additional method development. Resource constraints are leading to us being behind in our MAM01 development
*   Evelyn is drafting an analytical procedure for SEC on GA that will be more comparable to GAs data. This will detail additional requirements for handover from collaborators, more specifics to be shared in the new year
*   I've requested from Will to get a better sense of timelines for subunit work to build development timelines

# Handoffs
## Upcoming
*   **CLD → BMGF: Cry2oligo cell line (after beacon run tentatively scheduled for 1/23)**
*   STRIDE → BMGF: \[FILL IN\] (TBD)
## Ongoing
*   Hardware → Sasha: 1 Alpha-Spinda (Spin tube illuminator) (Mid) **December** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
## CLD - Monique
*   

## **CLD Collaborations:**
# Raspberry

## Green Apple - Emily
*   Round 3 cloning is underway!
*   Illumination optimization with round 1 clones is continuing this year in collaboration with the Opto/data teams
*   We've met with AnChem to discuss additional method development and standard procedures for post proA purified samples
*   We're in conversation with BPD about when they can run a GA line DASbox
    *   the team is currently summarizing info for top clones required for a BPD handoff
*   We also have a conversation planned with various technical and BD folks to ensure our current round of engineering will yield lines that can be passed to the customer (considering opto systems, scalability, light/dark operations, etc.)
## Bio CoS - Emily
*   CEDEX planned to ship by end of week! - from [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   Still need to finalize biologist to work with Sasha and help onboard the CEDEX
*   Yesterday [@Pete czerpak](#user_mention#75430545) received confirmation from Merck that 25L of media should arrive mid next week with the remainder coming a week later
    *   additives delivery date still to be confirmed
    *   update: or maybe arriving today!?!?
## high mAb titer project - Emily
*   Update: Alex T. is leading the overall project and now John H. is leading the CLD portion (subbed in for Max. Ho).
*   Cloning is underway and updated timelines and plans will be shared in next weeks project update
*   Notice: This project and others are being resourced by individuals who aren't managed by the project lead. This will continue to become more common within bio. Collaborating teams should still reach out to project architects/managers for project-related questions and individual's line manager for resourcing/performance questions/concerns. Please let me know if you have any specific concerns with this.
*   We will schedule the following meetings in the coming weeks:
    *   alignment meeting with AnChem regarding sample throughput and methods for the project
    *   Beacon reservation meeting with Shahram/Amritha
*   Question of what workstreams to focus on based on current progress towards Q1 high titer goal
    *   will decide in the next 1-2 weeks what to prioritize
## BMGF - Will
*   Inform: Nora supporting BMGF project. Cloning and cell maintenance
*   **2x Beacon runs this month - timing TBD**
    *   Kiana discussing with Amritha, Basanta re: timing of BMGF beacon runs (2 needed) relative to Raspberry
    *   there will likely be a prioritization discussion needed between BMGF and Raspberry beacon runs (difficult because Max Hoerner is out this week)
    *   if BMGF must wait until end of month to run Beacon, adds significant risk
*   Aims 2&3: STRIDE team is helping to generate cell lines with BLIMP and PYC2 into CMV-MAM01 clone
*   Request to elevate priority of BMGF samples (# 163, 153, 154) to #2 behind high titer samples - currently blocking handoff of cell lines to BPD
    *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) let team know they need to complete process for handoff to AnChem
    *   [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) will discuss triaging before SEC with Ian
*   Budget - working with Christina and Engine Room to get latest status and ensure we spend appropriately through end of March.
## Subunit Control - Will
*   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) for Epcoritamab (for patent) - when might method be ready to detect chain mispairing?
    *   first need samples to develop that method. now expected mid-feb. Ian talked with Shahram already
## GMP Illuminator - Will
*   **Bio/commercial roadmap - would be helpful to get the following information ASAP:**
    *   expected timing to lock the:
        *   target program(s) / use case the illuminator needs to support first (seems like GA is most likely)
        *   opto system
        *   host cell line
        *   final clone
    *   whether we are doing any process development for the first clinical program or just going through CLD
    *   Request for PMs to be included in roadmap sessions
*   [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) add Will to GA meeting
*   Team is visiting Lonza site in Bend, OR on 2/5!
*   Collaborating with Opto on requirements - waiting for feedback on doc sent in Dec

## Analytical Chemistry - Ian
*   We have carried through 16 experiments from 2025 into 2026
    *   Prioritized samples include-
        *   High titer for JPM conference (AC146-A)
        *   R1/R2 Opto clone host chassis (AC129/AC130-although I heard these may be deprioritized)
    *   Ask: If there are other priority samples please let me know as we balance new and backlog of experimentation - response from Emily/biostrategy below
        *   1\. getting high titer data from BPD DASbox run - confirm numbers for JPM (by EOD tomorrow)
        *   2\. John R. and Basanta's BMGF samples (need to finish submission process!)
            *   (# 163, 153, 154)
        *   3\. R1/R2 Opto clone host chassis (AC129/AC130-although I heard these may be deprioritized) - can be delayed; Submission was edited by Amritha
*   In discussion with Green Apple (scope increases!):
    *   Anchem agreed we would standup ProA-HPLC method for this project
    *   Anchem will update our ProA purification protocol to follow GA's composition, and establish an analytical procedure (purification, standardization, SEC) to be able to compare %monomer more directly with GA's internal data
    *   Anchem agreed we would run samples to confirm we are expressing the correct target Via LC-MS
        *   Screening of 4 of our intact LC-MS methods did not produce signal for GA, will require additional method development
*   On our development roadmap
    *   GA-ProA-HPLC- January
    *   GA- LC-MS- January
    *   GA- Purification/SEC- January
    *   Raspberry- ProA-HPLC- January
    *   MAM01- Charge Variants- February- Will be able to communicate relative comparisons in the mean time
    *   MAM01- %Monomer- February- Will be able to communicate some information as method is developed

## Data:
*   GLIDE
*   GA
    *   including 96 to 24 DWP comparison that could increase throughput
*   PTM control
*   CEDEX onboarding
    *   working with Sasha to scope automation of CEDEX output auto-upload

## Facilities:
*   Kuhner installation week after next
*   Address heat in CEDEX room
*   Option to find additional incubator space - managing budget is key aspect here; there are space options
    *   we're expanding the team
    *   flag this as a need - find an owner to make a business case in biostrategy
    *   would be helpful to get facilities estimate of when we can expand into new space

## Actions:
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) let BMGF team know they need to complete process for handoff to AnChem before samples can be run
*   [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) will discuss triaging between HPLC and SEC for BMGF samples with Ian
*   [@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244) / [@Emily Gale](#user_mention#54143731) flag need for more shaking incubator space and assign an owner in the next biostrategy meeting

*   Recap of our GA scalability and commercialization meeting - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XeQMcm69kntEihU07AWTmKBpjH6BkkXWuzEhODBLDy8/edit?slide=id.g2e61e735678\_1\_316#slide=id.g2e61e735678\_1\_316](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XeQMcm69kntEihU07AWTmKBpjH6BkkXWuzEhODBLDy8/edit?slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316#slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316) - still sifting through the notes so more to come!
    *   We're thinking hard about how to maximize the chance that the lines we're generating in round 3 are ready for prime time.
        *   Some outcomes included:
            *   keeping hardware in the loop about illumination patterns/intensities that may impact GMP illuminator form factor
            *   working with Sasha/Alex to determine when we can promote GA lines to DASbox
                *   meeting w/ BPD today to discuss top clones for handoff
            *   Heavily prioritizing opto system licensing conversations and considering how we can further de-risk the Cry2 system
*   The team will be using the new media batch + TE addition AT RISK (likely minimal risk) for production run and clone screening starting in the next 2 weeks
## Bio CoS - Emily
*   CEDEX is on it's way! (from [@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469) )
*   Meeting scheduled on Jan. 28 with myself, Cooper, incubator avengers to determine next steps for more shaking incubator space
    *   Going forward technical teams are responsible for making business cases for equipment and then Cooper will help us out massively by managing the equipment finding/vendor engagement/purchase/install part of the process.
## high mAb titer project - Emily
*   We've proposed a change in the 20g/L OKR to delay this deliverable (not yet approved!) which gives more time to focus more on building up a stable, reliable approach to consistently reaching high titers (from the cell line/vector perspective)
*   BPD has another DASbox run planned with the 2-3 Humira clone in Feb. that we hope will achieve our highest titers yet!
*   Project planning has been a bit delayed since there was a focus on getting cloning off the ground. This means:
    *   alignment with AnChem is delayed
    *   timelines and technical plans are still in flux
    *   we'll aim to review technical plans with biostrategy and project leadership in the coming weeks

### Top Announcements
*   
### Well Plate Illuminators (DX2, Deoxys)
#### DX2
*   Spontaneous restarts caused by voltage dropping (unstable voltage) has suddenly and whole-heartedly plagued the fleet. Top Priority to Fix This . Mitigation strategy is in place and appears to be effective so far!
*   New Kuhner incoming = team will work on all the items to get this ready including 3 new DX2s.
*   What is the current plan for how temperature shifts will be handled in incubators?
    *   need to know if there's a change in how the space is managed (e.g. different incubators for diff temperatures)
### Spin Tube Illuminators (Spinda, Sparbok)
#### Spinda
*   December: 1 Alpha unit available (set of 8). These are for the purpose of testing and giving feedback. Potentially also useful for R&D purposes (not a promise)
    *   Delayed because DX2 work is taking priority
    *   Sasha to run first Spinda test ~Dec 11. 3 spin tubes w/ cells. Comparison to sparbok. Gating when next 2 Alphas are deployed (Jan estimated)
    *   If this Alpha test doesn't happen, we are going to table Spinda until we have more resources.
*   Roughly 10 Beta-1 units - DESCOPED FOR NOW**, unless we can get more resources, we do not plan to work on Spinda-Beta anymore.**
#### Sparbok
*   
### DasBox Illuminator (Palkia)
*   Circuit board order will be made soon for next generation Palkias (needed end of January)
### Scale-Up Illuminator (Blastoise)
*   Initial data shows bleedthrough between wells (highest light levels next to lowest light levels) - this is likely because we use grey plates instead of black plates. This may be important in certain circumstances (if a plate plan is being made with high intensity wells next to dark wells, there may be bleedthrough) - this is qual not quant at this point .
