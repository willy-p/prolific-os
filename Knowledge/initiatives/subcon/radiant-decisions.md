## 2026-01-12: Accelerated CLD Timeline Demonstration

**Decision:** Proceed with early Wolf sorting for a subset of Epcoritamab pools to demonstrate a condensed CLD timeline, while keeping the original Beacon date of 2/13.

**Background:** BD wants to show Lonza how our platform can reduce bispecific CLD timelines. This uses Amritha's existing Epcoritamab pools as a real-world demonstration.

**Rationale:** Low risk (adds an earlier step, doesn't change critical path), high value for BD/partner conversations. Noreen and Amritha confirmed resourcing is feasible.
