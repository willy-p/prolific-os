# **Resourcing Discussion: Raspberry subunit control / Cinnamon / bsAb patent**
Wed, 05 Nov 25 · [monique@prolific-machines.com](mailto:monique@prolific-machines.com), [shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com](mailto:shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com), [max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com), [victor@prolific-machines.com](mailto:victor@prolific-machines.com)
### **Project Resourcing and Timeline Overview**
*   **Objective:** Align on near-term resourcing and prioritization across Cinnamon, Raspberry subunit control, and bsAb patent programs
    *   Focus on vector design and cloning work in immediate term
    *   Identify major task assignments for Q1 2026 planning
*   Current program timelines and dependencies:
    *   **Cinnamon (Radiant):** December 7th sequence delivery per grant (earliest start), production deadline May 15th for 1 milligram material
        *   Gates Foundation relationship concerns around timeline delays
        *   Legal terms and obligations must be finalized before work begins
    *   **Raspberry bispecific:** Awaiting sequence from Lonza
    *   **bsAb Patent:** Cloning can continue immediately
        *   7-8 vectors required for internal patent work
        *   6-7 vectors needed for construct generation
    *   **AAV project:** Wrapping up end of December, occupies ~50% of Noreen’s time
### **Resource Allocation and Strategy**
*   **Primary recommendation: Noreen takes lead on construct generation**
    *   Makes most sense given her background and current involvement
    *   Can dedicate other 50% of time to both Lonza bispecific and Radiant projects
    *   Will flex to 100% capacity once AAV work completes
    *   Already working on vector generation strategy with Shahram
*   **Makoto alternative ruled out**
    *   Currently overloaded and focused on GS work
    *   Better to avoid disrupting current workflow until new hire trained
*   **Support structure for production phases**
    *   Amritha available for supervisory oversight on experimental planning and analysis
    *   Need full scientist time for vector generation, cloning, and rework iterations
    *   CLD team handling later project stages
    *   Biology RAs being hired (Kiana/Max as hiring managers) to support cloning, transfection/selection, production runs
*   **Sequencing strategy to manage workload**
    *   December: Order pieces for Radiant, begin raspberry work if sequence arrives
    *   January: Stagger projects - master clones ready for one enables starting next
    *   Three-month timeline estimated per project from transfection through production runs
### **Patent Work and Next Steps**
*   **bsAb patent experimental data requirements**
    *   Confirmed: Can use anonymized Raspberry molecule for patent work
    *   Recommendation: Better to use different molecule if possible
    *   Max to review specific claims to determine required experimental data
    *   Key consideration: Avoid missing patent claims by using customer sequences
*   **Immediate actions before Thursday LT check-in:**
    *   Confirm named resources for each workstream
    *   Outline vector design and cloning strategy with Noreen/Shahram collaboration
    *   Finalize approach for ordering components vs. internal assembly to optimize Noreen’s time
    *   Review patent claims to specify needed experimental data

### **Lonza Project Timeline & Characterization**
*   Earliest production run: mid to end of March (assuming sequence received end of November)
*   Analytical approach (assuming no capex for additional instrumentation):
    *   Purification followed by intact and subunit characterization
    *   Potential sub-fractionation depending on molecular weight differences
    *   Signal quality on mispairs from target molecule critical
*   Method development status:
    *   Some methods started, ~few weeks away from being fit for Lonza’s trimer
    *   Preference to obtain reference material if possible
    *   Vidar to ask Lonza about reference material availability
### **Radiant Project Prioritization**
*   Key strategic questions needing answers:
    *   Position in global project hierarchy vs other priorities
    *   Whether analytical information is nice-to-have vs critical for de-risking
*   Current constraints:
    *   Without major tradeoffs, insufficient bandwidth for this work
    *   Technical strategy unclear - would require significant time investment
    *   Internal characterization toolkit limited in terms of instrumentation

# 2025-11-18 AnChem / Subunit

Tue, 18 Nov 25 · JellyBelly-1-Island Punch (6), [ian.ronningen@prolific-machines.com](mailto:ian.ronningen@prolific-machines.com), [shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com](mailto:shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com)
### **Context**
Meeting focused on developing analytical chemistry methods for subunit control of Radiant’s multibody bispecific molecule. The team discussed strategies for in-house characterization to enable faster screening of cell clones versus relying entirely on external analysis, with work expected to begin mid-February after receiving sequences from Radiant.
### **Notes**
*   **Molecule composition and structure**
    *   Complex assembly: 16 Fab1, 8 Fab2, 4 Fab3, 4 Fc subunits (total 32 components)
    *   Electrostatically assembled through ferritin interactions (not covalently bound)
    *   Each subunit has unique mass, enabling mass spectrometry differentiation
    *   Expected yield: 1-10 milligram range from Radiant, hoping to scale 1000x
*   **Proposed analytical strategies**
    *   Intact mass spectrometry or size exclusion chromatography
        *   Analyze assembled molecule to detect shifts toward specific subunits
        *   Monitor relative ratios based on light induction levels
    *   Electrostatic disruption followed by SEC
        *   Disassemble multibody then analyze individual subunit ratios
        *   Would require ProA purification (possibly Fab purification)
*   **Experimental design considerations**
    *   Two subunits (Fab3 and Fc) under optogenetic control
    *   Dark conditions: only Fab1 expressed
    *   Light induction: variable ratios of all subunits
    *   Goal is ballpark estimation for clone/pool screening, not precise quantification
    *   Assembly flexibility expected – ratios may deviate from ideal 16:8:4:4
*   **Resource and timeline constraints**
    *   Both analytical methods described as “non-trivial to develop”
    *   AnChem team fully booked through end of year with heavy backlog
    *   First samples expected mid-February 2025
    *   Instrument bandwidth limitations, particularly on HPLCs
    *   SEC methods have lower throughput (~20 minute runs)
*   **Internal vs external analysis comparison**
    *   Internal turnaround: ~1 week
    *   External research partner: 3-4 weeks typical, 2 weeks best case if highly engaged
    *   Shipping challenges to Canada due to regulatory classification as drugs/medicine
    *   Maintaining 40-96 clones for 3-4 weeks while waiting for external results would be operationally challenging
### **Key Takeaways**
*   Need material samples from Radiant and dedicated AnChem resources to develop methods
*   In-house capability critical for screening efficiency – external turnaround times too slow for clone selection
*   Both proposed analytical approaches are technically challenging and will require method development
*   This represents a strategic capability that could differentiate Prolific Machines in the bispecific market
*   Successful delivery could open opportunities with well-funded partners like Radiant
### **Risks Flagged**
*   **Resource allocation conflict**
    *   AnChem team already at capacity through year-end
    *   Would require deprioritizing other planned work
    *   Need leadership decision on resource reallocation
*   **Instrumentation limitations**
    *   Heavy utilization of existing HPLC systems
    *   May need additional equipment purchases
    *   Single point of failure risk if key instruments break
*   **Technical development risk**
    *   Both proposed methods are complex and unproven
    *   No guarantee of successful method development within timeline
### **Decisions & Action Items**
**Action Items:**
*   **Shahram**: Ask Radiant whether molecule can be denatured for analysis (before Friday meeting)
*   **Ian**: Draft proposed strategy document for purification and analysis methods
*   **Will**: Follow up with Alex on resource prioritization discussion
*   **Will**: try to model project cadence with internal characterization (1 week) vs external research partner (3-4 weeks, 2 weeks best case if very engaged. sample shipping to Canada)
*   **Team**: First ask Radiant about their current assay methods before finalizing approach
**Decisions Made:**
*   Focus on developing ballpark estimation methods rather than precise quantification
### **Slack Message to Team**
Hey team! Had an offline session with Ian and Shahram about analytical chemistry support for the Radiant bispecific project. Quick update on where we landed:
**Why we met:** Radiant’s multibody molecule (32 subunits total) will need custom analytical methods for subunit ratio characterization. We’re looking at developing in-house capabilities vs. relying on external partners.
**Key takeaways:**• Two potential analytical approaches identified – intact mass spec or electrostatic disruption + SEC • Both methods are technically challenging and will require dedicated method development • In-house analysis critical for screening efficiency (1 week vs 3-4 weeks external turnaround) • First samples expected mid-February, so we have some runway for planning • This capability could be a major differentiator in the bispecific market • Success with Radiant could open doors with other well-funded partners
**Resource challenges flagged:**• AnChem team fully booked through year-end with existing backlog • Would need leadership decision on reprioritizing work • Potential instrument bandwidth limitations
**Next steps:**• Shahram – checking with Radiant on molecule denaturing options (by Friday) • Ian – drafting proposed purification/analysis strategy • Will – discussing resource allocation with Alex and commercial team • All – getting Radiant’s current assay methods before finalizing our approach
Let me know if I missed anything or if you have thoughts on the resource trade-offs!

    *   What is the most likely media we will use for production runs?
    *   What is our estimated illuminator usage?
    *   **Technical deep dive scheduled for next friday 12/5 with Radiant.**
        *   **Questions / areas of interest to discuss?**
            *   Can we do ProA purification to measure titer here? What is the recommended titer assay?
            *   Are there issues with aggregation?
                *   How can we get an initial readout on aggregation?
            *   Any prioritization of goals across the 5 types of antibody/multabody?
            *   **Questions / areas from the SOW:**
                *   Expression benchmark data:
                    *   Performance data for fed-batch production of any **target(s)** that have previously been produced in stable cell lines (titer, production scale, days in culture, growth curve, information about key culture conditions e.g. temperature shift, aggregation data) for early pools.
                    *   Representative data for other targets:
                        *   Typical transient expression ranges for multabodies
                        *   Stable pool data for their lead program
                        *   Available context and data on why HIV trispecific multabodies are expected to be more difficult to express 
                *   HIV construct performance insights that will help inform vector design:
                    *   Predictions/qualitative ranking of which HIV Fabs/subunits:
                        *   Express better vs. worse (inferred from Radiant’s large panel of HIV trispecific constructs)
                        *   Can the easiest to express subunit be part of the Hferr subunit?
                        *   Are likely more/less detrimental to cell health when expressed
                    *   Use of existing RPLC / analytical data to correlate input DNA vs. output protein composition and infer subunit “behavior”
                *   Multabody component/stability info:
                    *   Data on assembled trispecific multibodies:
                        *   Stability profiles pre and post thaw (e.g., aggregation/SEC behavior) they already have on assembled HIV trispecifics
                        *   Any known “good/bad/ugly” subunit combinations Radiant has already characterized
                *   How can the difference between homo or hetero complexes be distinguished by SDS-PAGE (example: a correctly assembled heterocomplex molecule vs two different forms of homocomplexes can not be differentiated using SDS-PAGE).
            *   Additional questions:
                *   Expression balancing: As a strategy to balance ferritin vs fused domain expression, have you examined the use of deoptimized codon for ferritin and optimized codons for the fused domain?
                *   Host cell line: Have you evaluated expression in a XBP1- enhanced CHO host, and do you utilize BiP/PDl co-expression to improve assembly/yield?
                *   Particle formation: Do you more commonly observe incomplete particles or large aggregates? Are you able to share a SEC protocol that would allow us to screen and identify optimal pools/clones?
                *   Production: Do you use EDTA during production- what is its impact? Have you observed improved expression at reduced temperatures (30-33 degrees C)?

*   Titer improvements: we're planning to use a regime where cells are illuminated during seed train and production, to demonstrate benefit of separating growth and production

*   Analytical work:
    *   Western Blot
        *   Noreen has run it here with training wheels. Shahram has done many - they can work together on this.

### Vector Design Review
*   13 total vectors planned across 3 molecule types:
    *   IgG monoclonal antibody (MAb) - 1 vector
    *   Monospecific multibody - 4 vectors
    *   Bispecific multibody - 8 vectors
*   HIV target focus (RSV archived for now)
*   Promoter strategy:
    *   High opto: strong promoter for primary components
    *   Mid opto: ~50% strength for secondary components
    *   CMV constitutive controls included
*   Key design questions for Radiant meeting:
    *   Exact ratios needed for Fab components vs FC regions
    *   Whether C13/C14 components should be 1:1 or different ratios
    *   Pro A titer assay specifics (not standard elution buffer)
### Production & Analysis Approach
*   Radiant has Western blot separation method for complex molecules
    *   Eliminates need for Prolific to do analytical separation
*   Internal capabilities confirmed:
    *   Western blot equipment available (Shahram experienced)
    *   24-well screening planned for initial optimization
*   Target: demonstrate optogenetic benefit at each complexity level
    *   Simple MAb: improved titers vs aggregation issues
    *   Monospecific Multabody: controlled ratios + titers
    *   Bispecific Multabody: precise chain stoichiometry
### Next Steps
*   Will: Send question list to team by Tuesday EOD for Friday technical meeting
*   Team: Add questions to shared meeting notes doc (Will sharing in Slack)
*   Friday meeting: Technical deep dive with Radiant (Arif, Shinwen)
    *   Focus areas: ratios, titer benchmarks, analytical methods
*   Pending: Statement of work alignment before sequence sharing
*   Shahram: Confirm promoter strength characterization data availability

# 2025-12-09 Subunit Control Meeting

# Agenda
1. Discussion on technical scope
2. Review illuminator usage predictions
3. Discuss timing of methods for analytical chemistry

### **Discussion on technical scope:**
#### Anchor: Note from Vidar on Cinnamon's priorities for this project:
> They care most about being able to produce their HIV molecules at **sufficiently high titers & stoichiometry to be able to serve LMICs**, and their “conventional” molecules at sufficiently high titers & right stoichiometry for commercially viable manufacturing.  
> Since _they know we can’t get there in this POC,_ **what they want to see is directional data that we can significantly address these points:**  
> \- Separation of growth and production provides a benefit  
> \- We can impact stoichiometry with optogenetics  
> For now I think **we should set more qualitative goals since the scope of this project will not allow us to deliver a significant performance boost** - this is also aligned with the input arif got from their CEO: let’s consider this a true proof of concept, rather than a full proof of value. If we show a significant impact on both, I believe we can apply for further GF funding to improve.   
> They need both: sufficient titers and correctly assembled molecule  
> hence, they will want both and _will likely require a two color solution in a next phase, which would be great to have funded through the GF_

#### Message from Will on Friday:
1. Re: improving titer –
    1. **To mimic a CMV condition** they had suggested to continuously illuminate the cells during the seed train for a number of passages before production.
        1. Those cells would then be seeded in a production run the same length of time as the other conditions to compare always-on expression vs. expression induced mid-production run.
    2. [@Shahram](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/team/U08L0C1AT8R) you had commented on this in the SOW as I think Arif’s suggestion was not clear (he asked about illuminating at the onset of transfection)
    3. We could specify a success metric here e.g. “A statistically significant improvement in titer for the cells induced mid-production run”
[1:43](https://prolific-machines.slack.com/archives/C09QNPTSVQD/p1764971038382799?thread_ts=1764963081.232969&cid=C09QNPTSVQD)
2\. Re: Controlling subunit ratios, our desired outcome is:
_“Optogenetic tuning of individual subunit ratios within Multabody molecules.”_
A potential metric:
“Tuning light parameters results in different ratios of Fab and Fc regions in the produced Multabody.”
Curious to hear your thoughts!

#### Discussion:
*       *   **Titer improvements:** what makes sense for us to compare against to demonstrate titer improvements
        *   They have suggested a “CMV mimicking” condition where we illuminate the cells in the seed train, prior to a production run. Will this really demonstrate the benefits of optogenetics? What are the risks?
            *   **Here's what we propose:** we would prefer to use a CMV cell line for demonstrating titer improvements. Ideally, (1) you would send us your CMV cell line or (2) your constructs for us to transfect into our host cell line. We can use that as a baseline to demonstrate titer improvements. alternatively, we can just compare against your internal data for the specific molecule that we'll be testing
            *   if you're not able to share a cell line or construct with us, then we would be open to dropping the RSV lines and developing one or more CMV cell lines for comparison vs. the HIV opto lines
            *   regarding the CMV mimicking approach where we would be illuminating the cells in the seed train prior to the production run, we are open to doing this approach for our top 2-3 pools. However, it won't be feasible for us to do it for all 10 of the pools that we've proposed here
            *   we'll take this approach for the top 2-3 pools, for the final 2-3 passages prior to the production run (not immediately after transfection)
            *   **Here's our thinking:** illuminating the cells in the seed train likely won't be indicative of CMV performance
*       *   Shahram: Here is why: protein expression during the seed train process is generally minimal and won't impact culture growth unless the protein is fairly toxic. However, during production run or N-1 stage the cells start making much more protein and we can see the impact of productivity on growth at this stage. Therefore, illuminating during N-2, N-1, N vs. only illumination during N can show this results much better. Even CMV lines don't produce much protein during seed train culture.
    Constant illumination of cultures throughout the CLD will be very burdensome (incubator space and equipments).
    *   Should we drop one pool and add a single CMV pool?
    *   Can we compare pools such as 2 & 3 to demonstrate titer improvements for inducible system (e.g. by comparing amount of the Fab-Hferr that is under Opto vs CMV control?)

*       *       *   Options for control condition, to show titer improvement (in order of priority)
            *   Compare against their internal data
            *   They send us a CMV control cell line, we run it in our process
            *   Using top 2-3 pools: Illuminate cells from N-3 through production

*       *   **Optogenetic control of subunit ratios:** several of the new Multabody vector designs proposed by Cinnamon (Pools 2, 5, 7, 8 in the attached document) place both vectors under Optogenetic control, which would mean that the subunit ratios cannot be controlled by light intensity.
        *   For these pools, the goal is to demonstrate overall titer improvements by placing everything under opto control

**Table 2:** Overview of vectors that will be designed and created by Prolific. There are 5 conditions, each with a one vector and a two vector design, leading to 10 total pools. 

| Pool # | Molecule | Two-vector designs<br>(vector number denoted before design) | Opto Value add | Control for titer improvement |
| ---| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| 1 | RSV IgG1<br> | 1: HC (Opto) | 2: LC (Opto) | titer |  |
| 2 | RSV MB1 | 3: Fab-Hferr (Opto) | 4: N/C-Ferr (Opto) | titer |  |
| 3 | 5: Fab-Hferr (CMV) | stoich |  |
| 4 | HIV IgG1<br> | 6: HC (Opto) | 7: LC (Opto) | titer |  |
| 5 | HIV MB1 (Monospecific) | 8: Fab-Hferr (Opto) | 9: N/C-Ferr (Opto) | titer |  |
| 6 | 10: Fab-Hferr (CMV) | stoich |  |
| 7 | HIV MB2 (Trispecific A) | 11: Fab-Hferr1 (Opto) | 13: Fab2Hferr and N/C-Ferr (Opto) | titer |  |
| 8 | 12: Fab-Hferr1 (CMV) | stoich |  |
| 9 | HIV MB3 (Trispecific B) | 14: Fab-Hferr1 (Opto) | 16: Fab2Hferr and N/C-Ferr (Opto) | titer |  |
| 10 | 15: Fab-Hferr1 (CMV) | stoich |  |

**Number of Vectors: 16**
**Number of Pools: 10**

# **Subunit Control Biweekly Meeting**
Tue, 09 Dec 25 · [c\_1886bkqp25l48gc9mohbsoag264k0@resource.calendar.google.com](mailto:c_1886bkqp25l48gc9mohbsoag264k0@resource.calendar.google.com), [ian.ronningen@prolific-machines.com](mailto:ian.ronningen@prolific-machines.com), [shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com](mailto:shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com), [amritha.menon@prolific-machines.com](mailto:amritha.menon@prolific-machines.com), [noreen.wauford@prolific-machines.com](mailto:noreen.wauford@prolific-machines.com)
### **Cinnamon Project Technical Scope Alignment**
*   Primary goal: Show directional data for titer improvement and subunit stoichiometry control
    *   Not targeting specific quantitative numbers
    *   Proof of concept rather than proof of value for Gates Foundation funding
*   Key molecules and approach:
    *   HIV multibodies (difficult to express) - main focus
    *   RSV multibodies (well-behaved benchmark)
    *   Oncology multibodies
    *   Pool-level analysis only, no single cell cloning for this phase
*   Current titer baseline: ~3-4 g/L for regular multibodies
*   16 vectors total, 10 pools planned
### **CMV Control Strategy Discussion**
*   Cinnamon requested CMV-mimicking process (illumination during seed train)
    *   Team consensus: Doesn’t make technical sense
    *   Seed train is only N-1 with minimal carryover (20%)
    *   Won’t demonstrate growth/production separation benefits
*   Proposed alternatives:
    1. Request Cinnamon’s internal CMV cell line data for comparison
    2. Create single CMV control (heavy + light chain under CMV) for pool #4 only
    3. Early illumination experiment with top 2-3 performing pools
*   Next step: Write clear technical rationale explaining why seed train illumination isn’t representative
### **Pool Design Strategy**
*   Screening approach: Test all pools first, then detailed analysis on top 2-3 performers
*   Scale-up considerations:
    *   TPP tubes or shake flasks for seed expansion
    *   24-deep well blocks for production
    *   Current setup not optimized for illuminated seed trains
*   Pool priorities:
    *   HIV molecules remain primary focus
    *   RSV inclusion debated - may not show significant opto benefit
    *   Consider adding CMV comparison for better internal benchmarking
### **Internal Bispecific Project**
*   Ian developing epcoritamab quantification method
*   Timing questions around method development
*   All constructs using Cry2 system
*   Follow-up meeting scheduled to discuss details
###   

### **Next Steps**
*   Will: Email Cinnamon requesting internal titer data and CMV cell line options
*   Sharam: Write technical rationale for why seed train illumination approach isn’t optimal
*   Follow-up meeting: Internal bispecific project timing and technical details

## Notes

*   **Epcoritamab (Patent)**
    *   Vectors
        *   Next steps:
            *   we already have 2 vectors that would enable us to get one pool
            *   making 2 new constructs that enable 2 more pools
                *   will get sequencing data for this on Thursday. if good, then we'll have the DNA next week
            *   if the sequencing is no good, then cloning re-starts week of Jan 5
                *   in that case, troubleshooting is needed.
            *   if more cloning is needed for 2062 and 2065, we will decide as a group how to proceed. **Preference from Amritha is to transfect all at once**
    *   Host
        *   \- must be Cry2 because vector is Cry2-compatible
        *   Will get readout from current fed-batch production run - opto-hosts expressing mScarlet-IRES-HER2
            *   Alex selected two hosts for Raspberry project from original fed-batch run
                *   originally selected 9 based on titer and leakiness - downselected 2 based on doubling time.
                *   **Amritha to check with Alexandre re: transient transfection was done on all 9. Meet to look at data**
            *   these are post-thaw
            *   next step - take top 2 candidates (maybe 1-2 more based on current FB run)
    *   Transfections
        *   Transfections can happen next week earliest
        *   Three pools
        *   
*   Risks
    *   risk that medium strength promoter hasn't been characterized as much as the strong promoter we have a lot of experience with
    *   risk with all in one vector - induction decreases as we go down the vector
*   **Radiant:**
    *   [@Noreen Wauford](#user_mention#75485130) and [@Shahram Misaghi](#user_mention#81541324) to meet to discuss cloning strategy
    *   **risk:** more complex molecules may have more issues → pools may take longer to recover

Action items:
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) share patent with team
*   [@Shahram Misaghi](#user_mention#81541324) share technical goals from patent
*   [@Amritha Menon](#user_mention#81541323) **to check with Alexandre re: transient transfection was done on all 9. Meet to look at data**
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) **have a conversation in Biostrategy in early January on when we can use the Beacon for this project**

# Cinnamon/Raspberry/bsAb Patent Scoping & Resourcing

Mon, 03 Nov 25 · [monique@prolific-machines.com](mailto:monique@prolific-machines.com), [shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com](mailto:shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com), [sara.kemppainen@prolific-machines.com](mailto:sara.kemppainen@prolific-machines.com), [vidar@prolific-machines.com](mailto:vidar@prolific-machines.com)
### **Meeting Objective & Background**
*   Define work scope, resource allocation, and milestones for Radiant grant and related bispecific projects
*   Gates Foundation approved grant proposal for Radiant work
    *   $128k funding to Prolific Machines (remainder to Radiant for analytics)
    *   Still awaiting formal agreement terms from Gates
    *   Target start: January 2026 (pushed from December due to agreement delays)
*   Three interconnected work streams requiring resource allocation:
    *   Radiant HIV/RSV multibodies project
    *   Lonza bispecific work (sequences not yet shared)
    *   Internal patent bispecific work (provisional filed October 2nd)
### **Technical Scope & Deliverables**
*   Radiant project requirements:
    *   March 15, 2026: 8 stable pools expressing HIV multibodies under single color induction promoter
    *   May 15, 2026: Ship 1mg protein in conditioned media to Radiant
    *   6-7 vector constructs per molecule (potentially both HIV and RSV)
    *   Shahram as technical lead
*   Resource requirements per project:
    *   Vector cloning: 0.5-1 FTE (6-8 weeks)
    *   Cell line development: 0.5-1 FTE (10-12 weeks)
    *   Production runs: 1 FTE (4-6 weeks)
*   Timeline reality check: January start + 2.5-3 months CLD work = late May/early June delivery
    *   May need to negotiate delivery date extension with Gates/Radiant
### **Resource Allocation Challenges**
*   Current potential scientists:
    *   Construct generation: Noreen, Makoto, Ed
    *   Transfection/production: Amritha, Peyja, Basanta, Mare, Shahram
*   Key constraints:
    *   Noreen currently split between AAV work and bispecific PTM work
    *   Makoto busy with Raspberry constructs and vector working group
    *   New RA hire unlikely to be fully onboarded before January
*   Resource juggling scenarios discussed:
    *   If Lonza sequences received: prioritise Lonza bispecific work over internal development
    *   Potential to move Makoto from Raspberry to bispecific work with RA support
    *   Ed becoming available as AAV work wraps up end of year

# 2025-11-21 Cinnamon <> Prolific

Fri, 21 Nov 25 · [max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com), [sara.kemppainen@prolific-machines.com](mailto:sara.kemppainen@prolific-machines.com), [shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com](mailto:shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com), [vidar@prolific-machines.com](mailto:vidar@prolific-machines.com), JellyBelly-1-Juicy Pear (12), [ajetha@radiantbio.com](mailto:ajetha@radiantbio.com), [xinwenhe@radiantbio.com](mailto:xinwenhe@radiantbio.com)
### **Grant Announcement and Communications**
*   Gates Foundation announcing grant on December 2
*   Sara drafting joint announcement to share with Radiant after foundation announcement
*   Will coordinate with communications teams on both sides
### **Multibody Stability and Shipping Protocols**
*   Stability data available for both purified material and supernatants
    *   Previous oncology programs used similar shipping approach
    *   Can provide reference materials for benchmarking
*   Recommended shipping conditions
    *   Dry ice preferred, avoid agitation risks
    *   Standard practice: freeze cell culture fluid at -80°C using ultra-low temp freezers
    *   Ship in 50mL tubes or 250mL Nalgene bottles
    *   Use WorldCourier service (they have account) - DO NOT use FedEx
    *   Will perform freeze-thaw stability studies once sequences finalized
*   Media considerations
    *   Need Prolific’s specific media details for pH impact assessment
    *   In bicarbonate-based media, no detrimental aggregation impacts observed
### **Analytical Methods and Characterization**
*   Current Radiant protocols
    *   SDS-PAGE analysis (can share optimized protocol they have used)
    *   ProA titer (will transfer method - standard elution buffer won’t work)
    *   Preference for Radiant to perform purification
*   For Prolific internal development
    *   Cell culture fluid (CCF) analysis without purification acceptable
    *   Radiant will share reference material with us for method development
*   Expression levels and challenges
    *   Transient expression: 10-100mg/L depending on molecule
    *   Stable pools: 1-3g/L achieved (their lead monospecific program - easier to express than HIV multabody)
    *   HIV Fabs problematic due to extensive in vivo mutation
    *   Target: demonstrate even 1g/L would be significant success
*   Analytical turnaround time at Radiant: 2-3 weeks fastest case, depends on analytical queue capacity
    *   We can work with them to pre-book capacity
### **Technical Scope Refinement**
*   Arif’s strategic recommendations from Jacqueline meeting
    *   Test well-expressed multabody under optogenetic control for titer improvement
    *   Evaluate HIV trispecific molecules (1-2 variants)
    *   Stepwise complexity approach: HIV IgG → monospecific multabody → trispecific multabody
    *   Probe inducibility across different growth phases
*   Vector design approach
    *   Combination of single vector and multiple vector systems
    *   All multabody chains (minimum 3 even for “simple” molecule)
    *   Using CHOZN Elite cell line (newest version with improved yields)
*   Iteration cycles planned within timeframe rather than single shipment
*   Eight experimental pools to be defined collaboratively
### **Next Steps and Action Items**
*   Will: Work with Arif to deep-dive data review session with Prolific technical team for first week of December
*   Will: Establish Google doc for collaborative pool planning and vector design strategy
    *   Shahram: Share detailed list of 8 experimental pools for collaborative planning
*   Sara: Forward Gates Foundation announcement email
*   Radiant: Provide sequences and reference materials to enable vector design before Christmas
*   Legal: Arif’s team reviewing key terms document, targeting mid-to-end next week feedback
*   Xinwen and Arif visiting San Francisco in January (potentially around JPMorgan week)
* * *

# 2025-12-05 Prolific <> Cinnamon Technical deep dive

### Discussion Topics and Questions
#### 1\. Expression Benchmarking
*   Could you share performance data for fed-batch production of any Multabody targets that have been produced in stable cell lines?
    *   Titers, production scale, culture duration, growth curves, key culture conditions (e.g., temperature shifts), and any aggregation data from early pools.
    *   Sensitivity around transferring data. Remove statements from SOW around sharing this data. Can share verbal updates.
*   Are there representative data for other Multabody targets you can share, such as:
    *   Typical transient expression ranges for Multabodies.
    *   Stable pool data for your lead program.
    *   Context on why HIV trispecific Multabodies are expected to be particularly challenging to express.
#### 2\. HIV Construct Performance and Vector Design
*   Based on your experience with a broad panel of HIV trispecific constructs:
    *   Which HIV Fabs or subunits tend to express more or less efficiently?
    *   Could the easiest-to-express subunit be part of the Hferr subunit?
    *   Which subunits are most or least associated with cell stress or viability issues?
*   Have you used RPLC or other analytical approaches to correlate input DNA ratios with resulting protein composition, to infer subunit-specific expression behavior?
#### 3\. Multabody Stability and Assembly
*   What stability data do you have for assembled HIV trispecific Multabodies, both pre- and post-thaw (e.g., aggregation or SEC behavior)?
*   Are there known subunit combinations that have shown particularly good or poor stability or assembly behavior?
*   How do you typically distinguish between homo- or heterocomplexes by SDS-PAGE? (example: a correctly assembled heterocomplex molecule vs two different forms of homocomplexes can not be differentiated using SDS-PAGE)
#### 4\. Additional Technical Topics
*   **Expression balancing**: Have you explored strategies such as differential codon optimization (e.g., deoptimized ferritin, optimized fused domains) to balance subunit expression?
    *   Codon optimization varies between what was done internally (GeneArt) versus in stable pools with partner
    *   No differential codon optimization tested between ferritin vs. fused domains
    *   Need to check terms with GeneArt re: sharing DNA sequence. Preferred method is to share AA sequences, then we do codon optimization. Arif can assess similarity between DNA sequences.
    *   **Cinnamon can share signal peptide with Prolific.**
        *   Prefer to use Cinnamon's signal peptide for now
*   **Host cell line:** Have you evaluated XBP1-enhanced CHO hosts or co-expression of BiP/PDIs to improve assembly or yield?
    *   ExpiCHO used for transient. Stable pools achieved g/L titers in CHO-K1 derivative.
    *   Could be an interesting exploration for future work
*   **Particle formation:** Do you more commonly observe incomplete particles or large aggregates? Could you share a general SEC protocol that would allow us to screen for optimal pools or clones?
    *   Usually have both incomplete subunits and aggregates - can be removed by SEC
    *   the presence of these species has been reduced when expression is higher
*   **Production conditions:** Have you observed any impact of EDTA addition or reduced temperatures (30–33°C) on yield or quality?
    *   Have not tested EDTA. It may be present in the media (ExpiCHO media?)
    *   Any information on temperature shifts that have been used in MB production would be helpful for Prolific.
*   **Is glycosylation important for these molecules?**
    *   Afucosylation is interesting for them. Could be a good next step.

# Notes from Proposal:
*   Radiant does not have a method to distinguish between homo and hetero complexes by SDS-PAGE. They denature, reduce, and run on SDS-PAGE
*   Purification will be done at radiant, with Prolific sending the CCF
*   Radiant does not have specific data on any known good, bad, ugly subunit combinations that Radiant has already characterized

# unanswered questions from today's meeting
*   Can the easiest to express subunit be part of the Hferr subunit?
*   Available context and data on why HIV trispecific multabodies are expected to be more difficult to express
*   Sounds good. Do you know among these 3 different Fabs with H, N/C ferr which ones are harder to express? Even if you have some idea that would be helpful for us to select one host vs. another.

## **Prolific <> Cinnamon Technical Deep Dive**
Fri, 05 Dec 25 · JellyBelly-1-Juicy Pear (12), [shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com](mailto:shahram.misaghi@prolific-machines.com), [xinwenhe@radiantbio.com](mailto:xinwenhe@radiantbio.com), [ajetha@radiantbio.com](mailto:ajetha@radiantbio.com), [amritha.menon@prolific-machines.com](mailto:amritha.menon@prolific-machines.com), [sara.kemppainen@prolific-machines.com](mailto:sara.kemppainen@prolific-machines.com), [noreen.wauford@prolific-machines.com](mailto:noreen.wauford@prolific-machines.com), [max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com)
### **TL;DR:**
*   Prolific will proceed with the molecules and vector designs proposed by Cinnamon:
    *   Dual-vector designs only
    *   One RSV IgG and one Multabody to help us understand how this system works with a well-expressing MB
    *   HIV: one IgG, one monospecific MB, two different trispecific MBs (4 chains each)
*   Radiant will finalize top two Fab selections for HIV MBs by end of year after December 17th meeting with Jacqueline, then queue production in early 2025 following their site move
*   Sara and Arif working out legal terms of agreement
*   Initial production will target ~48 conditions in 24 deep well plates (duplicates), with scale-up based on internal SDS-PAGE assessment of highest expressing pools and Cinnamon’s analytics
*   Minimum analytics requires at least 150 μg purified material, with binding screens needing hundreds of μg (approaching 1 mg range)
### **Background:**
Technical deep dive between Prolific Machines and Radiant Bio teams to finalize statement of work for HIV trispecific Multabody production. Meeting focused on vector designs, expression strategies, production conditions, and analytical requirements. Radiant is moving sites next week, halting production until early 2025.
### **Meeting Notes:**
### **Vector Design and Expression Strategy**
*   Prolific confirmed feasibility of dual vector approach for trispecific constructs
    *   Pools will be less representative compared to single vector designs
    *   Still expect to show shifting between different subunits during light induction
*   Expression approach using promoter strategies:
    *   H ferritin under constitutive CMV promoter (assembles readily by itself)
    *   Other components (Fab 2, Fab 3, Fc) under optogenetic inducible system
    *   All optogenetic components will assemble simultaneously when induced
*   Construct specifications clarified:
    *   RSV Multabodies use single monospecific Fab (same sequence for constructs 1-3)
    *   Trispecifics (constructs 7-10) are four-chain molecules with different Fab combinations
    *   Need clear naming convention for similar Fabs to optimize vector design strategy
### **Production Planning and Scale**
*   Initial screening approach:
    *   48 total conditions in 24 deep well plates (duplicates)
    *   Three conditions per construct: dark, low light intensity, high light intensity
    *   Approximately 15 constructs total
*   Titer expectations and scaling:
    *   Unknown titers for these challenging molecules
    *   Conservative estimate: 50-100 mg/L (150-300 μg in 3 mL after losses)
    *   More optimistic: 0.5 g/L (1.5 mg in 3 mL)
    *   Scale-up strategy: assess SDS-PAGE to identify highest expressing pools, then move to shake flasks while conducting initial analytics
*   Material requirements:
    *   Minimum analytics: 150 μg after purification
    *   Binding screens: hundreds of μg (approaching 1 mg range for triplicates)
    *   Thermal stability studies: 1.5 mg
### **Fed-Batch Production Conditions**
*   Radiant’s stable cell line performance (proprietary data limitations):
    *   Achieved gram per liter titers for lead program
    *   CHO-K1 derivative cell line using transposon-based integration
    *   14-day production runs (unless viability drops below 80%)
    *   Seeding density: 0.3 million cells/mL
    *   Splitting range: 2.5-6 million cells/mL, split down to 0.3 million cells/mL
*   Temperature shift protocols available from Xinwen
*   Media composition will be shared once Fab selections finalized
### **Analytical and Shipping Considerations**
*   SDS-PAGE analysis:
    *   Four-chain molecules have overlapping bands (65-75 kDa range)
    *   H ferritin distinguishable from other components
    *   Recommended to run HCCF directly rather than purified material
    *   Radiant will provide expected profiles once production starts
*   Shipping and stability:
    *   Freeze-thaw effects generally mild (not complete molecule abolishment)
        *   Proposal is to not spend resources trying to compare freeze-thaw effects in Prolific's vs Cinnamon's media
    *   Freeze shipment on dry ice preferred over 4°C liquid shipping
    *   4°C shipping presents uncontrolled mechanical agitation risks
    *   Centrifugation at \_\_\_\_ for 5 minutes (specifics not too important), then 0.22 micron filtration (important part)
### **Technical Specifications and Optimization**
*   Codon optimization strategy:
    *   Radiant uses GeneArt internally vs. proprietary optimization for stable pools
    *   Plan: share amino acid sequences, Prolific performs codon optimization, compare results
    *   Will use Radiant’s public signal peptide to minimize variables
*   Host cell considerations:
    *   Currently using ExpiCHO for transients
    *   Enhanced CHO hosts (XBP1, co-expression strategies) interesting for future work
    *   Not recommended for initial scope to minimize variables
*   Glycosylation importance:
    *   Afucosylation relevant for enhanced Fc receptor binding
    *   Potential future work on partial glycosylation (20-70% levels) for personalized medicine applications
### **Sequence and Timeline Coordination**
*   Fab selection timeline:
    *   Currently have top 3-4 combinations, need to narrow to 2
    *   Decision depends on whether to include challenging Fab sequence
    *   Meeting with Jacqueline on December 17th for final selection
    *   Sequences delivery contingent on legal agreement execution
*   Production restart:
    *   Radiant moving sites next week (production currently halted)
    *   Queue up production early 2025 once back online
    *   Reference material delivery: early February target (earlier than March SOW date)
### **Decisions, Action Items & Next Steps:**
*   Will Paton will incorporate meeting comments into SOW and send updated version to Radiant team
*   Radiant to finalize top two Fab selections after December 17th Jacqueline meeting
*   Radiant to check GeneArt terms regarding DNA sequence sharing with Prolific
*   Teams to align on codon optimization approach: Prolific will optimize amino acid sequences and compare with Radiant’s versions
*   Legal teams working to execute agreements by end of next week
*   Radiant will share media composition and temperature shift protocols once Fab selections confirmed
*   Production queue for early 2025 following Radiant’s site move completion
*   Remove fed-batch performance data sharing requirements from formal SOW (can discuss verbally)
