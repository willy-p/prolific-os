|  Project Description  This collaboration brings together Prolific Machines’ photomolecular manufacturing platform and Radiant Biotherapeutics’ next-generation HIV Multabodies to evaluate the production and tunability of potent multi-specific bnAb-based therapeutics. By using light to precisely tune Multabody subunit production in engineered cell lines, the collaboration aims to unlock scalable and affordable manufacturing of trispecific Multabodies for global HIV treatment. Radiant’s Multabody platform enables the design of highly polyvalent, multispecific therapeutics based on Fc and Fab regions fused to light chain apoferritin. Balancing the number of Fc and Fab regions during production is important for the activity of the Multabody. Radiant’s HIV trispecific Multabodies consisting of HIV bnAbs are highly promising as a cure for HIV due to their combination of multispecificity and polyvalency, which allows very high potency and thus lower doses. However, the inherent expression challenges of bnAbs remain, potentially limiting achievable titers.  Prolific has developed a library of over 700 inducible systems with a range of expression levels. Using these systems, Prolific has demonstrated that separation of growth and production through optogenetic induction can significantly increase titer of antibody expression, including for difficult to express proteins. Moreover, Prolific has shown the ability of optogenetic systems to control the level of expression to any desired level over the culture duration, enabling control over single subunits relative to others in order to control stoichiometry of the assembled protein.  The proof-of-concept will be executed in Prolific’s established single-color optogenetic chassis, which offers a robust and well-validated system for precise light control. Starting with this high-performing chassis reduces technical risk and allows the team to clearly demonstrate the two outcomes of the project: Outcome 1: Optogenetic decoupling of growth and production phases to enable higher titers of HIV multabodies from CHO cells. Outcome 2: Optogenetic tuning of individual subunit expression and ratios to improve CHO cell expression of HIV Multabodies. By proving these outcomes in a reliable single-color context, the project will establish a strong foundation for future translation to multicolor optogenetic systems. Multicolor control will expand the platform’s capabilities, enabling even finer and more flexible regulation of complex multimeric therapeutics. Together, these results will drive further development of Prolific’s Photomolecular platform toward scalable, high-quality production of next-generation HIV Multabodies. The proposed project is expected to run over 8 months. It will begin in December 2025, with Prolific initiating cell line development. Cell line engineering and optimization will conclude in May 2026, after which supernatant material will be shipped to Radiant for purification and analytical characterization, supported by the second funding allocation of $71,500. The collaboration will conclude with joint data analysis and preparation of a comprehensive final report, anticipated by August 2026\. Project Plan  The proposed collaborative project consists of 5 phases. Both Radiant and Prolific are rapidly innovating on their platforms. Therefore, further details of the experimental plan will be worked out together by both parties based on the latest insights upon starting the grant to maximize the potential impact and value of the POC.  Phase I: Selection of anti-HIV or tool molecules  Radiant will select between 1-7 Multabody designs for evaluation which will include one well-expressing Multabody, as well as one bi- or trispecific HIV bnAb multabody with up to 4 total subunits.  Time: 1 week Output: Selected HIV Multabody design candidates Phase II: Cell pool development   In this phase, Prolific will design and engineer stable cell pools for each selected Multabody design. Constructs will be cloned and characterized, followed by transfection, selection, and recovery of pools. Subunits will be integrated into Prolific’s optogenetic host chassis using a combination of light-inducible and constitutive (CMV) promoters. Based on the selected molecules and Radiant’s most recent data at the start of the grant, Prolific will generate 8 engineered pools based on its single color optogenetic cell chassis. Single color rather than multi color optogenetic control has been selected for initial proof-of-concept work due to the time required to generate a multi color optogenetic cell chassis which would extend beyond the grant duration. The engineered cell pools will enable demonstration of the two proof-of-concept outcomes: Outcome 1: Decoupling growth and production Prolific will create a pool where all subunits are under optogenetic control. This will test the benefit of separating the growth and production phases. Additionally, Prolific may create pools that only express a subset of the subunits to test the benefit on particularly hard to express Fab-ferratin complexes.  Outcome 2: Tunable subunit stoichiometry Additional pools will be created by placing one or more subunits under optogenetic control, while expressing the remaining subunits constitutively under CMV promoters. This configuration will allow Prolific to demonstrate the ability to precisely adjust subunit ratios using light. The exact design and breakdown of pools will be determined collaboratively with Radiant, guided by their latest in-house results. Time: 3 months Output: Cell pools generated for the target molecules Phase III: Small-scale expression studies  Conduct small-scale expression studies (24 deep well plate or 15ml spin tubes) to titrate expression of the optogenetically controlled component by varying light exposure. Harvest and ship supernatant to Radiant for purification and analytics. We expect to include at least four light conditions per pool.  Time: 2 months Output: Shipping of 1 milligram of protein in conditioned media per experimental condition to Radiant. Phase IV: Purification and analytics by Radiant Upon receiving the samples, Radiant will execute its available purification protocols to enable further analytics. Purification to include Protein A followed by size exclusion chromatography. Then, Radiant will execute its Multabody analytics suite to assess yield and the effect of varying light intensity on component ratios. Analytics to include titer, purity, SEC-MALS, component ratio analysis, hydrophobicity, aggregation profile, and thermal stability.Radiant will also evaluate the expressed Multabodies in antigen and FcR binding assays, and multi-clade pseudovirus neutralization assays to validate that both the activity and breadth of neutralization is achieved, confirming that the molecules are behaving as expected.  Time: 2 months Output: Dataset containing results for aforementioned analytics Phase V: Joint report Prolific and Radiant will collaboratively compile results into a joint report with conclusions and proposed next steps. Time: 3 weeks Output: Written report containing the data, conclusions and proposed next steps Background   According to the WHO, 39.9 million people worldwide were estimated to be living with HIV at the end of 20231. While significant advancements have been made in HIV prophylaxis, a definitive, effective, and affordable cure for HIV remains elusive. To address this critical need, Radiant Biotherapeutics is advancing a highly potent, multivalent, multispecific HIV program built on its Multabody platform2,3,4. Radiant has previously demonstrated that HIV Multabodies can provide exceptional potencies and breadth that dramatically exceed that of IgGs3. Furthermore, the improvements in in vitro activity endowed by the Multabody relative to IgG can translate into the ability to protect against infection in vivo at low doses4. Together, these results highlight the potential of the Multabodies to enable scalable and cost-effective global access to these therapeutics. However, a key challenge in developing antibody-based therapeutics for HIV is their reduced developability relative to antibodies manufactured for other disease indications. HIV bnAbs are typically isolated from chronically infected patients living with HIV and have evolved in vivo to have conformational plasticity that achieves viral breadth, but as a consequence, also present sequence liabilities, polyreactivity, and expression challenges5,6,7.  In parallel, Prolific Machines is tackling a complementary barrier: the cost, complexity, and quality limitations of therapeutic protein production. Prolific’s photomolecular platform, which leverages optogenetics, uses light to control gene expression, offering precise, real-time modulation of protein expression to improve manufacturability of complex biologics. Prolific has so far demonstrated up to a 4.5-fold increase in the titer of monoclonal antibodies and difficult-to-produce molecules. This proposal brings together Radiant and Prolific in a first-of-its-kind proof-of-concept study to explore optogenetic control of HIV Multabody subunit expression. Through this demonstration of the synergy between the two platforms, Radiant and Prolific aim to show a path to cost-effective, high-quality production of anti-HIV tri-specific Multabodies using some of the most potent bnAbs identified to date. By creatively leveraging optogenetic control over the expression of the Multabody subunits to improve Multabody yield, we aim to make the therapeutic accessible to patients around the world.   We hypothesize that optogenetic control over the expression of one or more Multabody subunits in a single stable cell line can drive higher titers of the subunits and assembly of the complete Multabody molecule, offering a unique platform to optimize yield as well as therapeutic function.  Collaboration & Future Outlook The key outcome will be a POC demonstration that optogenetic regulation of subunits can increase Multabody yield as well as enable correct assembly while preserving therapeutic potency. These findings will derisk and guide subsequent decisions on the optogenetic engineering strategy for production cell lines, process development, and scale-up for the HIV therapeutic with the intent to lay the foundations for further collaboration between both teams for both therapeutics in the Gates Foundation’s remit and other Radiant programs.  The management of this project and its intended outcomes are structured to align directly with the Gates Foundation’s mission and requirements. The work advances the charitable purpose to evaluate light-controlled production and tunability of potent multi-specific antibody-based therapeutics for a scalable HIV treatment, addressing a disease that disproportionately affects the world’s poorest populations. In terms of strategic fit, it responds to the call to action from the Grand Challenges Annual Meeting Announcement 2025\. Prolific and Radiant will jointly oversee the program through biweekly coordination meetings, transparent data sharing and analysis, ensuring accountability at every step. In line with the Foundation’s Global Access principles, all results will be used to guide follow-on development so that successful proof can be translated and scaled towards into a cost-effective manufacturing solution for anti-HIV treatment for low- and middle-income countries. Beyond the timeframe and funding for this collaboration, the ability to effectively build on this project and its results will depend on several factors. The molecules evaluated in this project will generate insights that extend beyond the immediate candidates, helping guide how best to design and control Multabody components for future development. These results will also establish the groundwork for advancing a lead Multabody, including single-cell cloning, creation of a research cell bank, and downstream process optimization to support manufacturability at larger scales.  In this project, we will demonstrate the effect of putting one or two subunits under optogenetic control of a single wavelength to demonstrate the ability to control subunit stoichiometry generally. In a subsequent project, we would want to work with at least two different wavelengths, to allow control over the relative stoichiometry of more subunits for optimal potency and titer. This expanded scope of work would require additional funding, ideally as a continuation from the Gates Foundation.  Both companies are committed to working together beyond the scope of this grant to ensure an affordable and scalable manufacturing process for these potent HIV Multabodies in low and middle-income countries. For Radiant, the results of such a follow-up project will provide validation that Prolific’s platform is able to produce complex multispecific Multabodies at high titers and optimize them for activity. For Prolific, the follow-up project will further demonstrate that light-controlled cell lines can make difficult-to-express proteins, such as multispecifics, that otherwise suffer from low yields and high cost of goods sold (COGS), commercially feasible. Together, the demonstration that Multabodies can be successfully manufactured at scale with the desired quality characteristics and with low costs using optogenetics would expand the potential applications of the Multabody to an even broader range of disease areas including the globally accessible treatment for HIV and other diseases of global importance across the Gates Foundation portfolio.  Risks and mitigation strategies  As with any ambitious effort, the project faces risks and potential challenges.  Risk 1: Some HIV Multabody designs may remain difficult to express despite the benefits of optogenetic regulation.  To address this, the project will evaluate in parallel multiple candidate molecules with different combinations of bnAbs Fab regions, as well as a Multabody format that is known to express well, in order to ensure that the concept can still be validated. This risk materializing would also inform potential future work in the expression of these difficult Fab regions, for example by expressing cofactors that aid their expression, either constitutively or under optogenetic control.  Risk 2: Control over a single subunit may not be sufficient to fully optimize subunit ratios.  The key goal of this project is to demonstrate optogenetics provides the control that allows the tuning of subunit ratios. The ability to control the subunits will serve as a POC for the concept, which can then be expanded on to cover independent control of multiple subunits in a follow up project. This can inform future work with multiple optogenetic systems controlling different subunits with different wavelengths of light. To reduce this risk, Prolific will include pools with control over different subunits and inform its engineering choices based on previous transient and stable experiments performed by Radiant.  Operational risks include the need for timely execution of material transfer agreements, as well as transfer of materials and data, which will be mitigated by pre-agreed timelines and biweekly coordination meetings.  Other benefits to the applicants  Through this collaboration, Prolific will extend the application of its photomolecular platform beyond mAbs, cytokines, and Fc-fusion proteins into the highly complex space of multispecifics, enhancing its capacity to address a broader range of difficult-to-express biologics. To deliver the results of the project, Prolific will further refine its workflows for light-regulated sub-unit expression. Radiant will optimize workflows for high-throughput purification and analytical QC of small-scale supernatants (1 milligram of protein in conditioned media) in order to improve the efficiency at which the MBs produced in Prolifics’ cell lines are purified.

### **Beneficiary Overview \-** completed by the foundation

The following section is an explanation from the perspective of your foundation contact regarding the beneficiaries of this work, how the project activities will address the needs of the beneficiaries, and their perspective on why you are uniquely the right organization to achieve the greatest impact through this project.

#### **Beneficiaries –** completed by the foundation

* Who are you doing this work for? The work needs to benefit a specific (and identifiable) group of individuals or organizations that may either be (i) disadvantaged in some way; or (ii) expected to benefit from or utilize project learnings. This group is likely already described in your program strategy documents – leverage and/or briefly summarize relevant portions of those materials as applicable.  

Common examples of these types of groups include:  

* Economically disadvantaged individuals and families (e.g., smallholder farmers, students facing barriers to access or opportunity, poor or low-income populations), or those who otherwise lack access to affordable and necessary goods or services (e.g., vaccines, diagnostic tools, sanitation, financial services, etc.)    
* Individuals impacted by diseases disproportionately affecting the developing world    
* Individuals impacted by a natural or other disaster    
* Policymakers or other influencers who can influence issues relevant to programmatic strategy   
* The public (if educating and informing the public on an area of strategic importance to the foundation)   
* Intermediary organizations who will, in turn, directly reach one or more groups described above (e.g., media/advocacy partners) 

| This work will benefit vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries who are exposed to HIV or who have been infected with HIV.  Multabodies are up to 10,000 times more potent than monoclonal antibodies and can target several parts of a virus or other pathogen at once.  This is extremely important for pathogens that can mutate and escape from a single monoclonal antibody.  This technology also has the potential for protecting the poorest populations from other infectious diseases such as malaria, RSV, sepsis, influenza, and infections casued by coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and other pathogens that affect people living in LMICs.  |
| :---- |

* If the proposed grantee would also directly benefit from this work (beyond receiving grant funding) explain why these benefits are inextricably linked to the achievement of the project’s programmatic objectives. For example, there may be no way to develop a new technology, vaccine, agricultural or educational product, etc. without building a new market or expanding the manufacturing or other capabilities of the organization. Benefits to the grantee may include increased customer base, entry (or financial/other de-risking of entry) into new markets, increased revenues, and/or acquisition of significant capital equipment.   

* Additionally, please: (1) indicate whether the proposed grantee would undertake this work in the absence of foundation funding, and/or (2) provide context for why, in the absence of such funding, it would not be incentivized to undertake this work at the scale, or on a timeframe, that the foundation deems necessary to achieve the desired programmatic impact.  Relevant context might include situations where the grantee’s business model or products/services are currently focused on High to Middle Income Countries (HMICs), it believes the foundation’s priority markets are too risky, it needs technical assistance/thought partnership to deliver products to Low to Middle Income Countries (LMICs)or target beneficiaries, etc. 

| Both grantees will benefit from this work as it will help to expand the utility of the optogenetics CHO cell platform to multabodies and HIV which has a commercial market in the global north, but which is also a high priority (i.e. HIV prevention and HIV functional cure) for GF in the global south. The grantees’ commitment to global access will ensure a positive impact in the foundation’s target geographies. The grantees would not undertake the work for HIV without GF funding.  The insights gained from this work may also benefit other projects at Prolific Machines and Radiant including discovery and development of multabodies against other infectious diseases besides HIV. |

#### **Project Impact on Beneficiaries –** completed by the foundation

* How will the project activities address the needs of the individuals or organizations for whom you are doing this work?  The link between the activities and these groups should be direct and measurable.  To the extent this can or will be more fully addressed in the Global Access section of the proposal, only a brief explanation should be provided below.  In addition, for “early” work that may inform or lead to subsequent funding opportunities (e.g., planning or “proof of concept” grants, feasibility studies or platform/core research and development projects), why is this investment a necessary first step towards achieving your strategic objectives and programmatic impact on the beneficiaries described above? 

| This work will benefit vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries who are exposed to HIV or who have been infected with HIV.  At this early stage of research, the full impact on our target populations is unknown but could be very significant.  This initial investment will inform the feasibility of using two novel platform technologies for producing cost-effective biologics for the prevention or treatment of HIV.  If successful, additional investment will be needed to realize the true impact in LMICs. |
| :---- |

#### **Organizational Fit and Capacity –** completed by the foundation

* How is the proposed grantee uniquely qualified to undertake this project and achieve the foundation’s desired impact?  Does the grantee have the ability to properly track and report on the use of the foundation’s funds?  Your response should describe your assessment of at least the following:    
* The proposed grantee’s experience with projects of similar size and scope;    
* Your knowledge of the grantee’s staff, activities, reputation, and practices; and   
* The proposed grantee’s ability to manage the results of the project (including any intellectual property rights) to achieve the strategic goals (e.g., through publication, licensing to third parties, commercialization, etc.). 

| Each of the grantees in this investment is an active GF grantee.  Radiant is funded to develop HIV Multabodies for prevention and functional cure under grant INV-062181 and PRI INV- 051612\.  Prolific Machines is funded to develop CHO cell-production of monoclonal antibodies using optogenetics (light induction) to reduce the cost of manufacturing under grant INV-072141.

### **Government Engagement**

* Will this project include engaging with governments, government staff and/or encouraging others such as the public or partners to do so?  

\_X\_No     

\_\_\_Yes (If “yes” please provide responses to the below)

Engaging with governments, including providing technical assistance, may be considered lobbying under the U.S. federal tax laws as well as under other applicable registration/disclosure rules at a local, state, or national level. 

Explain how the proposed government engagement activities funded by the foundation will comply with the lobbying rules and exceptions as summarized in the foundation’s [Advocacy Guidelines](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/advocacy-guidelines.pdf). 

Your response should demonstrate your understanding of the relevant restrictions and exceptions (*e.g.,* administrative action that does not include legislative activity, non-partisan analysis) as well as how you will manage compliance (*e.g.,* staff and sub-awardee training, legal counsel engagement, tracking staff time, etc.). Simply stating that you are not lobbying or that you are aware of the rules is not sufficient for our documentation. For example, clarify which activities will rely on a lobbying exception (detailed in the [Advocacy Guidelines](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/advocacy-guidelines.pdf)), or explain why a policy or other dissemination (*e.g.,* social media, sign-on letters) is not direct or grassroots lobbying. In addition, staff whose job duties include directly influencing government policy decisions/actions or advising governments are not solely funded by the foundation.

| N/A |
| :---- |

* If your work will include California, Massachusetts, or New Mexico activities, please confirm that you will not use foundation funding to advocate that a state or local government in California, Massachusetts or New Mexico issue a new regulation, amend an existing regulation, or take similar action that would be considered lobbying in those jurisdictions.  

\_X\_\_Yes, I confirm

\_\_\_N/A, work will not be conducted in California, Massachusetts, or New Mexico  

If working in these states, please also explain how you will manage compliance within the state or local lobbying rules and exceptions so that foundation funds are not used for lobbying in these jurisdictions, a definition broader than the U.S. federal tax rules noted above. Your response will help the foundation comply with donor required “source of funding” laws in these states.

| Prolific Machines does not currently engage in any lobbying matters, and the funds provided by Gates Foundation will be exclusively used for the execution of this project. |

## **Budget Information** {#budget-information}

The purpose of this section is to supplement the information provided in the Excel budget template by justifying how the budgeted items are necessary to implement project activities and accomplish project results. Please focus on key costs and risks and avoid repeating information contained in the budget template. Together, this narrative section and Excel budget template should provide a complete description that supports the proposed budget. Please note that our budget template uses cash-based accounting. For questions below that are not relevant to your project, answer “N/A”.

For additional instructions and guidance on the cash-based budget template, see the [Grant Budgeting & Financial Reporting Detailed Instructions](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/budget_template_instructions.docx).

### **Budget Summary**

* Explain the major cost drivers and how costs relate to planned activities and target outcomes. Also, explain any potential risks in spending and any plans to mitigate those risks. In the Excel budget template, an *additional dimension* can be defined to break down costs beyond the standard expense categories (e.g., by geography, product candidate, projects within a portfolio, or other). If you are defining such an additional dimension, please use it as you explain the major cost drivers here.

| The primary cost driver for this project is personnel at Prolific Machines, totaling $ 67,714, which primarily supports Prolific’s efforts in generating and characterizing engineered cell lines. This includes cell line development, optimization, and initial testing under selected light conditions. To support the evaluation of multiple Multabody designs, we are intentionally pursuing a broader range of constructs while keeping the light conditions limited for this initial phase. An additional $71,500 is allocated to our collaborator, Radiant Biotherapeutics, responsible for analytical and in vitro assays, enabling detailed assessment of titer and functionality across the selected designs. Supplies ($42,200  ) cover consumables necessary for molecular cloning, cell line development, and assay development. The project does not involve travel expenditures. Indirect costs are budgeted at $18,141 (10%), including facilities and equipment costs, in line with policy guidelines (under 15% indirect cost rate for for profit organizations). All cell lines will be stored for potential use in follow-on projects, maximizing the long-term value of this foundational work.   *Estimated Budget*  *Personnel (including salary, fringe benefits, tuition, or other direct compensation)*  $67,714      *Subcontracts, including your collaborator(s), if applicable.

### **Financial Update**

The purpose of this section is to help the foundation understand expenditures in relation to the work performed under this grant during the most recent reporting period and the upcoming one(s). Please provide actual expenditures in accordance with cash-based accounting for past periods and projected expenditures for future periods by updating the Excel budget template and use this narrative document to share additional explanations. Together, this narrative section and Excel budget should provide a complete quantitative and qualitative description of the current financial state of the project.  

For additional instructions or questions regarding cash-based accounting, see the [Grant Budgeting & Financial Reporting Detailed Instructions](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/budget_template_instructions.docx).

#### **Latest Period Variance**

**“Latest period variance”** compares expenditures that occurred in the most recent reporting period against the projections that were provided at the beginning of the same period.  See the “Financial Summary & Reporting” sheet in the Excel budget template for the calculated variance (for example, column AD, starting on row 29 for period 1). The budget template also includes an “Analytics” sheet for convenient calculation of variances. 

* Did the project spend more or less than anticipated? At a high level, what are the reasons for spending more or less than projected (such as, programmatic changes, delays in recruitment, etc.)? 

|  |
| :---- |

* Please provide a detailed explanation for any expense category in which the variance was greater than 10%. This should include an explanation of relevant project decisions or changes to actual costs compared to prior assumptions.

|  |
| :---- |

#### **Future Period Projections**

In the Excel budget template, please provide estimated expenditures ("projections") for all future periods of the grant (for example, in the “Financial Summary & Reporting” sheet, after period 1, populate the yellow cells in column T and following). It is important that your projections are realistic and consider the latest plan of activities with updated costs. For example, projections should not just carry forward previously unspent budget amounts into the next period without reassessing expected spending for each future period. In total, the projections should not exceed the total approved grant amount. The budget template’s “Analytics” sheet may be helpful for comparing current to previous projections. 

*Note**:** Over the course of a grant’s life, the foundation may adjust the timing and amounts disbursed to the grantee. This is done to avoid oversized cash balances on grantee bank accounts when spending is slower than originally budgeted. Realistic and up-to-date projections are a crucial input for right-sizing disbursements.* 

* How have your projections for the remaining periods changed compared to your previous projections (from your most recent progress report, or original proposal if this is the first report) and why? Please discuss any project adjustments and shifts in scope, assumptions, timing, decisions etc. which will affect spending. If you had previous discussions with the foundation on changes, please mention.

* In the table below, please provide information for all subgrantees or subcontractors receiving grant funds. The total of the column titled *Amount disbursed to subawardee in most recent reporting period* should equal the actual subaward expenses reported for this period in the Excel budget template's “Financial Summary & Reporting” sheet. Add more rows as needed. 

| Type of Subaward (grant or contract) | Organization Name | New and/or newly identified subawardee? | Amount disbursed to subawardee in most recent reporting period (USD) | Total amount disbursed to subawardee to date\* (USD) | Total amount spent by the subawardee to date\* (USD) | Total subaward amount (USD) |
