# Specification

**Title:** COMPOSITIONS, METHODS, AND SYSTEMS FOR CONTROLLING COMPLEX MOLECULE SUBUNIT EXPRESSION

## Background
[0001] Multimeric proteins comprising multiple subunits play essential roles. Multimeric proteins can comprise homomeric assemblies of identical subunits or heteromeric assemblies of distinct polypeptide chains. These complexes are critical for diverse functions. Recombinant protein production for multimeric proteins can be challenging in research, industrial manufacturing, and biopharmaceutical development.

## Summary
[0002] To effectively express complex molecules (e.g., multimeric proteins) in cell lines, genetic vectors containing coding regions that are transfected into the cells can be used. For multimeric proteins, it is often unclear which specific subunits of these molecules will be the limiting factor in achieving the necessary stoichiometric balance and proper configuration among all the subunits involved. The expression of complex molecules can be managed using expression vectors, designed to control the transcription and translation of target genes (vector configuration). However, the challenge lies in the sheer number of different vector configurations/combinations to be tested.

[0003] One powerful technique that has emerged in this field is optogenetics, which employs light-sensitive proteins (or light-responsive proteins) to precisely modulate the activity of a protein-of-interest under specific light-responsive promoter unit. This approach enables the regulation of expression of transfected coding regions of complex molecules, offering a high degree of control over gene expression.

[0004] The present disclosure provides methods, compositions, and systems for controlling complex molecule (e.g., multimeric polypeptide) subunit expression through cell line development processes and optogenetic expression controls. By utilizing both optogenetic and constitutive expression systems in a combinatorial barcoded vector design, control and optimization of specific complex molecule subunit expression levels can be achieved.

[0005] In some aspects, provided herein is a system for producing a multimeric polypeptide complex comprising a plurality of polypeptide subunits. This comprises a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a first polypeptide subunit operably coupled to a first promoter unit; and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding the first polypeptide subunit operably coupled to a second and different promoter unit. In some embodiments, the first promoter unit comprises an optogenetic promoter unit, and the second comprises a constitutive promoter.

[0006] In some aspects, provided herein is a system for producing a multimeric polypeptide complex comprising: a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a first polypeptide subunit operably coupled a first optogenetic promoter unit that responds to a first light; and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding the first polypeptide subunit operably coupled to a first constitutive promoter. The expression level of the first polypeptide subunit is regulated by modulating exposure of the system to the first light.

[0007] Provided herein is a system for producing a multimeric polypeptide complex comprising: a first polynucleotide sequence encoding a first polypeptide subunit operably coupled to a first optogenetic promoter unit; and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a second polypeptide subunit operably coupled to a second optogenetic promoter unit.

[0008] In some aspects, provided herein is a system for producing a multimeric polypeptide complex comprising a plurality of polypeptide subunits, the system comprising: a first polynucleotide molecule encoding at least two copies of a first polypeptide subunit of the plurality; and a second and different polynucleotide molecule encoding at least one copy of a second and different subunit of the plurality.

## Detailed Description
[0033] In some aspects, provided herein are methods, compositions, and systems for producing complex molecules. Controlling the expression levels of individual subunits of a complex molecule may be desirable. In some cases, individual subunits can be rate-limiting for correct assembly or expressed in excess.

### Multimeric Polypeptide Complex
[0035] In some aspects, provided herein is methods, compositions, and systems for producing a multimeric polypeptide complex. The complex may comprise at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, at least five, at least six, or more subunits.

[0036] As used herein, a "promoter unit" may refer to a nucleic acid construct that directs transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid sequence. In some cases, the promoter unit may comprise a constitutive promoter. In some cases, the promoter unit may direct transcription in response to a regulatory factor (e.g., light-controllable transcriptional activators).

[0048] In some embodiments, a multimeric polypeptide complex can comprise an antibody or fragment thereof or an immune complex. Antibodies can cover a vast array of formats including but not limited to: Fab fragments, F(ab')2 fragments, Fv fragments, scFv, BsAb, trispecific antibodies, diabodies, DVD-Ig, VHH domains, and nanobodies.
