## Executive Summary - Key Risks

| Risk | Potential Impact on Milestone/KR | Mitigation |
|------|----------------------------------|------------|
| Cloning vectors laid out within SOW may be challenging | **Low** - 1-2 month delay, depending on complexity | Would require re-designing cloning strategy based on failure mode |
| Cloning trispecific MB with single vector may be challenging | **Low** - 1-2 month delay, depending on complexity | **Containment:** Would cancel this work stream if cloning is unsuccessful |
| Positional effects within vector change subunit expression levels | **Low** - Unlikely to be significant enough to require re-work based on signals from Radiant | However, if the impact was significant, it would delay the project by two months – would require re-iterating vector design based on learnings |

## Executive Summary - Key Decisions

| Decision | Status | Proposal or Path Forward |
|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| Adding one vector design and associated pool with a single vector for one of the trispecific Multabodies | **Informed** (Project team) | Team is aligned on scope addition. This should help increase the probability of improving titer for trispecific Multabody, which is most important to Radiant. |
| Opto system selection for Radiant vector designs | **Upcoming** | Planning to use Gavpo for Radiant because it is more de-risked. But the vector designs can interchangeably use Gavpo or Cry2. Final opto system will be selected based on upcoming Raspberry and MAM01 pool data. |

## Upcoming Data/Deliverables

| Deliverable | OKR/Milestone | Date & Status | Aligned Specifications/Requirements |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Data:** Epcoritamab - first pool production run data | Customer Goal intermediate step | ~Feb 21 | Initial 10 day fed-batch production run in 24 DWPs for 24 Epcoritamab pools. Data will be used to down-select pools for cloning on Beacon. |
| **Data:** Radiant - first pool production run data (SDS-PAGE only) | Customer Goal intermediate step | ~Apr 1 | Initial 10 day fed-batch production run in 24 DWPs for 24 Epcoritamab pools. This initial data from SDS page will provide early signal on success of light modulated subunit control and titer improvements for Multabodies. Radiant will provide further analytical data ~1 month later. |
