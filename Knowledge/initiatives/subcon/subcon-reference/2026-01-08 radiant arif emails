Hi Will,
Thanks for your patience as we reviewed the SOW. I have attached here a copy with some comments and suggested edits.
I saw your other email but it looked like most of the questions you asked were included in the SOW and so hopefully this addresses these points, but happy to discuss further on Friday during the call.
Looking forward to connecting then.

Subject: RE: Radiant <> Prolific Proposed Statement of Work

Hi Arif,
Thanks for the comments on the SOW and for clarifying the vector-table nomenclature and potential clone-screening work. After an internal discussion today focused on how we demonstrate titer improvements, we realized the current SOW structure may not give the clearest comparison for evaluating the optogenetic system.
One of our shared goals is to show directional titer improvement for the HIV Multabodies, benchmarked against constitutive expression, so Radiant can directly assess the added value of optogenetic control relative to your current approach.
Right now, the SOW (1) uses only two-vector designs and (2) relies on seed-train illumination as a CMV mimic, without a true CMV control. Our concern is that this may understate the benefit of optogenetic control at the pool stage.
**Proposed adjustment**
To get a cleaner constitutive comparison, we’d like to propose the following change:
*   Replace Pools 5 and 6 with single-vector designs, one driven by CMV and one by the optogenetic promoter.
*   This would give us a straightforward “CMV vs. opto” comparison at the pool stage, while keeping the rest of the two-vector design space intact.
We believe this will provide a more interpretable readout of incremental titer benefit relative to a realistic CMV baseline.
**Seed-train illumination (“mock CMV”) control**
If you feel a CMV-mimicking seed-train illumination arm is still important, we’re open to including it with a narrower scope:
*   Run the seed-train illumination control only for our top 2–3 pools in a second round of production runs, rather than for all 10 pools.
*   For those priority pools, we would illuminate during the final 2–3 seed-train passages before the production run, where expression and growth/productivity trade-offs are more meaningful.
**Next steps**
Could we schedule a short call (20–30 minutes) to align on the comparison strategy that will give Radiant the most decision-useful proof-of-concept readout on titer improvement?
Here are some windows that work on our side:
\- Fri Dec 12: 3:30–4:00 pm, 5:30–6:00 pm
\- Mon Dec 15: 2:45–4:15 pm
\- Tue Dec 16: 1:15–1:45 pm, 3:30–4:00 pm, 5:45–7:00 pm
\- Wed Dec 17: 4:45–5:30 pm, 6:00–7:00 pm
\- Dec 18: 11:00 am–1:00 pm, 5:00–7:00 pm
If this general direction sounds reasonable, please let us know what works best for you, or feel free to suggest an alternative comparison that you think would be more informative.
Thanks,
Will

Hi Arif,
I hope your call with Jacqueline went well today! Thank you again for taking the time to meet with us on Monday to align on the strategy for incorporating a CMV comparison into our designs. I've attached the latest version (Rev 004) of the SOW to this email. I’ve included some rationale for the various pools to ensure our shared understanding is reflected in the document.
Following the meeting, Amritha had a question: would you be able to share one of your CMV pools with us to use as a control for our process? A CMV pool for the RSV Multabody would be ideal, but an HIV Multabody pool would also suffice.
Thanks,
Will

Hi Arif,
Thanks for flagging the issue with our vector designs for the monospecific MBs. We’ve updated the design to reflect the intended 2:1:1 ratio for FabAHferr : FabANferr : FcCferr in the monospecifics, incorporating four genes (including two copies of FabAHferr) to achieve this balance. The revised vector designs are attached in the Word document.
As for the CMV pools, we were wondering if it would be possible to obtain a frozen aliquot of a stable cell pool expressing one of the molecules I mentioned in my last email (RSV MB or HIV MB). While it’s not essential, it would serve as a useful control for comparison. Let me know if this can be arranged.
Thanks!
Will

Thanks Will and Arif,
@Arif,
Yes, the plan is to have a CMV stable cell line that expresses one of your Multabodies as a control in our hands to ensure that we can more or less replicate what you get.
Also, Thanks for your pointer on the vector design
@will and @Arif,It will be very helpful to have a meeting to go over all the vector designs to ensure that we are all aligned before starting to clone.

Subject: Re: Radiant <> Prolific Proposed Statement of Work

Hi Arif,
Just following up on my previous email. I would like to understand the strategy for multibodies a bit better.
If we have a ratio of 16:8:4:4 for Fab-HFerr:Fab-NFerr:Fab-CFerr:Fc-CFerr for a Multabody, that means that for a 32 available positions, we will have a total of **28 parts Fabs and 4 parts Fc** in Multabodies. I do understand that for Trispecific Multabodies we will have 16 of Fab1, 8 of Fab2, and 4 of Fab3 + 4 Fc moieties. but if for the monospecific we use: HighOpto-Fab1BHferr-HighOpto-Fab1BHferr-HighOpto-FabB1Nferr-HighOpto -FcCferr **without** using a Fab1Cferr, the ratios will become **24 parts Fabs and 8 Parts Fc** in the Multabodies.
Are we good with that ratio? Will having more Fc moieties impact the function of Multabodies?
Best,
Shahram

Subject: RE: Radiant <> Prolific Proposed Statement of Work

Hi Shahram, Will,
Will, thanks for clarifying the points in the SOW, everything is clear from my side.
Shahram, it’s a very good point. The gist is that yes, there may be a discrepancy between the Fab # in mono and trispecifics. The reality is that we know that a monospecific MB won’t be a lead candidate and so it acts as a comparison for how expression may change when we increase complexity (going from mono to tri-specific).
Most of our neutralization data is with trispecifics consisting of 28 Fabs. We have one experiment where we tested a trispecific using 24 Fabs (mimicking the monospecific design) and we had a small but significant reduction in viral neutralization activity. Its clear to us that 28 Fabs in a trispecific design are preferable for activity which is why we recommend this design. If possible, by keeping the same stable pool plan and only using the optogenetics, it might be worth exploring the 24 Fab combination in parallel to the 28-Fab combination. If not, I still think this is the best plan forward.
I hope that clarifies things but please let me know if there are any additional questions.
Thanks,
Arif

Thanks for explaining Arif,
Yes, that clarifies almost all my questions. Once the sequences are decided and finalized, let's go over the vector designs one last time before we start cloning (just in case!).
The 2 vector pools may result in some pools (or more likely clones) with 24 vs. 28 Fabs when using different light intensities, but we likely need different vector designs to achieve that more precisely.
Best,
Shahram
