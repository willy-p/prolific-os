### **Updated Guidance on Using LLMs (ChatGPT, etc.) at Prolific**
**Do not use the “Share” function**
The **“Share” feature in ChatGPT creates a public URL**. This feature creates a **public URL** that may be **indexed by Google** and is discoverable via search, as [this recent article](https://www.fastcompany.com/91376687/google-indexing-chatgpt-conversations) showed.
**Never use the “Share” button when working in ChatGPT.** If you need to share output, copy/paste the text into Slack or a document.
**Use only company approved Team accounts**
All LLM use at Prolific should happen via company-managed accounts (e.g., ChatGPT Team), which ensure:
*   Conversations are private to our workspace
*   Data is not used to train external models
*   Access is auditable and controlled
Do **not** use personal or public accounts for work-related content.
**Avoid inputting sensitive or proprietary information**
While helpful for summarizing, drafting, or generating ideas, LLMs are not appropriate for:
*   Internal financials or projections
*   Unreleased experimental data
*   Confidential project details
*   Employee or candidate information
*   Proprietary code or models
When in doubt, don’t paste it.
**Summary**
*   Never use the “Share” button
*   Only use Prolific-approved accounts
*   Don’t enter anything confidential or sensitive
*   Use screenshots or direct text for sharing
*   Treat LLM output as unverified suggestions, not final answers

# Nov 2025: Madeleine reviews Linear

**Evaluator:** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
**Date:** 6 Nov 2025
**Tool Name:** Linear
**Link:** [https://linear.app/](https://linear.app/)
Private ([https://app.clickup.com/t/868g66kf8](https://app.clickup.com/t/868g66kf8))
**Type:** Product management
**Security Review:** ✅ Approved
**Team / Function:** HW Team project - seeing if this was a potential for PM software
**License Level:** Free
**Pricing:** basic = 10/user/month, business = 16/user/month
**TL;DR Summary:** I tried build product management for DX2 in linear - this may be acceptable for software production but I did not find it sufficient for hardware production.
* * *
## 🎯 1. Purpose & Use Case
**What problem does this tool aim to solve?**
_(Briefly describe your use case and what you hoped it would help with.)_
I was hoping it would be more reliable than clickup in terms of project management software , as the ads seemed promising. Clickup is unreliable / clunky / hard to navigate.
**How did you use it in your workflow?**
I added some "issues" (aka tasks) for upcoming dx2 work in order to see if I like how the information is presented.
* * *

## 💬 3. Key Insights
**What worked well?**
_(Features or moments that genuinely helped your work.)_
Nothing genuinely helped my work
**What didn’t work / pain points?**
_(Any blockers, frustrations, or gaps.)_
It doesn't provide enough space / layers for the complexity and interconnectedness of tasks. It is best used for work where tasks can be neatly chunked and there is minimum finish-to-start dependency.
**Any “aha” moments or creative uses?**
_(Unexpected things the tool did well or new workflows it enabled.)_
I like that the "project update" part is just 1 or 2 sentences.
* * *
## 🧩 4. Recommendations
**Would you recommend we explore this tool further?**
*   No — not impactful enough or too risky
    *   I mean, some people may like it for the limited case mentioned above, but it was not high-applicability or workflow-changing. It did not suit my needs.
**Who would benefit most from this tool?**
_(E.g. Scientists, PMs, Engineers, Commercial team, Everyone)_
Product managers who are working on a software or similar project with discrete chunks of work which can be effectively managed at the task-layer and have minimal duration and complexity.
**What next step do you recommend?**
_(E.g. 1-week pilot, training session, skip for now, revisit later, etc.)_
Skip for now.
* * *
## 🔐 5. Security & Privacy Considerations
**Does the tool handle company or customer data?**
_(Y/N, and if yes, what kind?)_
No, it can but in this case it did not
**Any red flags or unclear terms?**
_(If unsure, note here for Declan’s review.)_

*   **In what specific tasks or areas do you find AI most helpful?**
    *   **Summary:**
    *   Coding and Data Analysis: AI is extensively used for coding assistance, including debugging, generating boilerplate, writing Python code for data analysis, and creating simple code for Excel/Sheets.
    *   Text Editing and Summarization: Respondents frequently use AI for proofreading, editing, polishing text, summarizing documents, condensing long text, and refining emails and messages.
    *   Learning and Research: AI aids in learning new areas of biology, quickly understanding conclusions in disparate fields, finding resources/reference articles, aggregating data from papers, and discovering answers to "hard to google" questions.
    *   Brainstorming and Ideation: AI is helpful for brainstorming ideas, quickly evaluating ideas, and initial roughing out of concepts.
    *   Modeling and Optimization: AI assists in refining numerical approaches to modeling/optimization/simulation, and reviewing algorithmic options in a machine learning/modeling context.
    *   Limited Use: One respondent indicated little interest in using AI, finding it largely unhelpful for the handful of things they have tried.
    *   **Actual responses:**
        *   Summarizing the information and editing
        *   summarizing documents and cleaning up written text like emails, feedback, etc.
        *   Brainstorming ideas. Editing messages. Writing and debugging code.
        *   I have been using AI to help us discover answer to the "hard to google" questions we come across all the time. For example when I am looking for what spore-killing detergents are compatible with coated and uncoated PCBs made of various materials. I also use it to make my messages shorter / more organized.
        *   Narrowing down inventory options with particular specs; creating checklists for personal responsibilities; building bespoke apps
        *   Basic line completion during coding, boilerplate generation
        *   Helping with Python code for data analysis
        *   Coding, brainstorming, editing text/emails
        *   Coding, google sheets functions
        *   Two major areas: (1) learning new areas of biology by asking in-depth questions about aspects of our science that would take me a long time to learn from our biology team, and (2) refining numerical approaches to modeling/optimization/simulation and so on.
        *   Quickly evaluating ideas and building quick code modules
        *   finding resources/reference articles, making plans or messaging more complete
        *   Note taking, notes summary, polishing existing text
        *   Aggregating data from papers, coding
        *   Proofreading documents
        *   Coding help
        *   Document summaries, condensing long text format into shorter paragraph format, generation of simple code (Excel, Sheets, Python scripts).
        *   research and editing
        *   Initial roughing out of ideas/code
        *   Proofreading, summarizing, and best practices
        *   writing, brainstorming, understanding
        *   I don't really at this point. I have little interest in using it for most things and the handful of things I've used it for have been largely unhelpful.
        *   quickly gaining an understanding of conclusions and open questions in disparate fields of knowledge
        *   I find it most helpful in learning new aspects of biology without peppering our team with questions, and also reviewing algorithmic options in a machine learning/modeling context.
*   **What are some of the challenges or concerns you have regarding the use of AI at work?**
    *   **Summary:**
    *   Accuracy and reliability issues: Frequent "hallucinations" (making up information), lack of accuracy, poor performance in tasks like math, and overgeneralization of information lead to a lack of confidence in the tools, often requiring users to spend more time checking work than if they had done it manually.
    *   Data and Intellectual Property (IP) concerns: Concerns exist about data confidentiality, IP leakage, and ensuring company data is not shared or used for training by external AI models, emphasizing the need to use company-approved accounts.
    *   Limited tool access and resources: Some users lack access to professional or pro versions of tools like ChatGPT due to usage limits, and others are unsure how to effectively use the existing company-provided AI tools and desire more training.
    *   Impact on critical thinking and work quality: There is concern that individuals may over-rely on AI for critical thinking, and it can be difficult to distinguish between high-effort, precise documents and those quickly generated by AI which may have subtle issues.
    *   Other concerns: A few responses mentioned concerns about global energy consumption and the perception that AI is overused, as well as the personal concern about AI potentially performing their job better than they can.
    *   **Actual responses:**
        *   Maybe privacy
        *   I don't know how to take advantage of the AI tools we have. I'd love to learn more about how AI can and should be used at work!
        *   Hallucinations can make use of AI take more time than just doing something without it. AI chatbots are not great at writing. Our limited suite of AI tools means I have to censor what I'm putting into non-Prolific-approved AI tools.
        *   I only use the company account since I know that keeps our data away from the pool that openAI can pull from for training. I don't feel there is a personal privacy concern but I can imagine for data it is important to use the company account.
        *   Concern is just global energy consumption and a perception that it is overused in general.
        *   IP leakage, AI doing my job better than I can
        *   none
        *   It gets hard to distinguish whether someone really put a lot of effort in a document so that it is on point/precise and only contains the relevant information or whether someone just used AI that generated on a first view an impressive document which has a lot of issues in the detail.
        *   Obviously they lie/make up stuff sometimes
        *   I don't have access to ChatGPT Pro most of the time because of usage limits.
        *   Lack of accuracy for current models and overgeneralization of information stemming from these models
        *   Accuracy of the AI tools (they are so bad at math)
        *   ChatGPT sometimes just makes things up so I don't find it great at generating things from scratch
        *   Our data should not be shared, first of all. Second, I'm concerned about individuals relying on AI to do their critical thinking for them.
        *   confidentiality
        *   It will just make stuff up
        *   It is not always clear to me whether the information used in answering my prompts is generated solely by my queries or also those of other people in the company. If the latter is the case, one could question whether all of that information is accurate.
        *   concerns with summarizing things like commercial contracts that it might not be completely accurate - always check work.
        *   Of the handful of times I've used it for relatively straightforward questions, it's been wrong at least 60% of the time so I have little to no confidence in it.
        *   I wouldn't really say I'm concerned, but I find I need to use these tools on problems I have some "taste" on, i.e. I can judge responses for when they are bullshit, or that are easy to confirm correctness. So I often give ChatGPT a hard algorithm to solve, but only if I can write a test for it. Otherwise I'll need it to help me derive the answer sufficiently for myself, not pop out an answer that can frequently be hallucinated.
*   **"Magic Wand": What is one task you wish an AI tool could do for you to make your job easier?**
    *   **Summary:**
        *   Research and Literature Review: There is a desire for AI to perform better and more comprehensive literature reviews, including patent and FTO analysis, and to assist with scientific questions without fabricating information.
        *   Information Retrieval and Synthesis: Users want an AI tool that can search and synthesize information from various internal documents (Drive, ClickUp) to find previously investigated topics, existing data/protocols, or collect and automatically update customer-related documents.
        *   Data and Presentation Generation: Requested capabilities include automatically generating plots from raw data into presentations, cleaning up slides, and turning sketches into illustrations or figures.
        *   Programming and Automation: Respondents wish for AI to perform agentic automation of tedious work and to act as a reliable "senior programmer" instead of a "shoddy junior programmer" requiring constant double-checking.
        *   Specific Design and Tasks: Other wishes include AI to design circuit boards from raw requirements, identify materials/attributes from pictures of devices, and assist with CAD. One respondent humorously wished it could replace the engine room or refill La Croix.
        
    *   **Actual responses:**
        *   sift through all drive, ClickUp, and other documents to dig up data/protocols I saw once, but can't figure out how to find
        *   Search all of our documents to find out if someone else has investigated something here.
        *   I wish I could give it pictures of the devices rather than describing the materials/finishes/other attributes one by one. Also, I wish it could help me more with CAD. Also, I wish it were better at making visual presentations of information. Sorry... that was 3 things.
        *   (Just haven't scheduled time to sit down and figure it out) note taking/action item generation from meeting transcripts
        *   Design circuit boards from raw requirements and refill the la croix
        *   Patent and literature research - curious to learn more about dedicated AI for this purpose.
        *   No lying when asking scientific questions
        *   Better literature review.
        *   Agentic automation of the tedious work.
        *   replace engine room with it :)
        *   Collect all documents about customer into one synthesis that keeps on being automatically updated
        *   Generate automatic plots from raw data sources and put them into a google slide
        *   I wish I had AI that could read through a large and correctly answer questions about it and extract data from it without making things up.
        *   If AI could level up from a shoddy junior programmer that requires me to check and double check their work to a senior programmer that can be trusted....
        *   I am good for now :)
        *   Comprehensive literature searches.
        *   Cleanup of slides; turning sketches into illustrations/figures/slides
        *   think it could replace me eventually.. not sure if that makes my life easier or not.
        *   FTO analysis
        *   I wish we have a better integration for proper literature review with ChatGPT. I haven't used tools like elicit or others yet, but would like to.
        *

*   **Which more advanced AI tools would you be interested in using?**
    *   **Summary:**
        *   Coding and design tools: Interest was expressed in integrated coding tools like Copilot, as well as AI for circuit board design and 3D modeling.
        *   Biology/Metabolic Modeling: There is interest in tools like AlphaFold/AlphaMissense, and developing a trainable model for metabolic modeling of cell lines, ideally with integrated protein folding dynamics.
        *   Presentation/Visualization: A desire for an AI that could create better presentations was noted, with a specific comment that ChatGPT's image generation and plotting of data are not very good.
        *   Access and Recommendations: One respondent noted using up their ChatGPT Pro access quickly and would value unlimited access, while others expressed reluctance due to proprietary info concerns and a need for recommendations or more information.
        
    *   **Actual responses:**
        *   I don't know enough about them to say :(
        *   ai circuit board design or 3d modeling could be cool. also if there is an ai that makes better presentations or something that would be great.
        *   If I had the time, I'd look into generating and developing a trainable model that could start a metabolic modeling package for our cells, ideally integrated with deeper insight protein folding dynamics. Both Python and MATLAB have open source models available on the web, but they need the work of curation and training on our cell lines to make them useful.
        *   integrated coding tools. copilot for example.
        *   Haven’t explored; would love to hear recommendations from others. I’m reluctant to try out tools myself for use at work (proprietary info concerns)
        *   i dont really know - i know the image generation and plotting of data is not v good on chatgpt.
        *   alphafold/alphamissense
        *   I use up my ChatGPT Pro very fast, e.g. I haven't had access in weeks since I used it up on PRADA work. There is a marked downgrade from Thinking to Pro, and it would be very much worth it to me to have unlimited access to Pro.
        *

#### **Step 0️⃣ — Security & Privacy Review (Required for New Tools)**
Before testing any tool that isn’t already approved (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Granola, etc.), we’ll do a quick security review.
**Who:** Declan (Chief Data Officer)
**Purpose:** Confirm the tool’s terms of service, data privacy, and storage policies meet our company standards.
**What to Submit:**
*   Tool name + link
*   Short description of intended use
*   Whether any company or customer data will be shared
**Turnaround:** up to **1 week**
> This step ensures we protect our data while still moving fast on experimentation.
* * *
#### **Step 1️⃣ — Try It in Your Workflow**
Use the tool naturally in your daily work for **15–30 minutes** — no need for a contrived demo.
Try tasks that actually matter to your team (e.g., summarizing an experiment, writing an email, coding, or research).
Capture quick notes or screenshots as you go.
* * *
#### **Step 2️⃣ — Document Insights**
After you’ve used the tool for a few sessions, fill out the PAWS AI Tool Evaluation Template.
This should take **10–20 minutes** and captures:
*   What worked
*   What didn’t
*   Ease of use, quality, value, privacy, etc.
*   Whether it’s worth piloting more broadly
Add your evaluation to the ClickUp list so others can review and build on your findings.
* * *
#### **Step 3️⃣ — Share and Discuss**
We’ll meet **every 3–4 weeks** to share learnings and pick 1–2 promising tools for deeper testing or rollout.
During each meeting:
*   A few members share a quick summary or screenshot demo
*   We align on which tools to explore next
*   We identify ways to share tips, prompts, and use cases with the wider team
* * *
#### **⏱️ Expected Time Commitment**

| Activity | Time |
| ---| --- |
| Security review (if needed) | up to 1 week turnaround |
| Individual testing + notes | 30–45 min |
| Filling out template | 10–20 min |
| Optional sharing in meeting | 5–10 min |

* * *
#### **💬 Reminder**
> The goal isn’t a perfect report — it’s quick, useful feedback.  
> Think of this as _crowdsourcing our collective AI intuition_ so we can focus on tools that truly make work easier, faster, and better.

* * *
### 📍 **Next Steps**
#### Before the meeting:
*   Think about where AI could make your work or your team’s work easier or faster.

[@Alex Toda](#user_mention#75436469)
*   Case study - comparing ChatGPT vs Gemini for Excel/Sheets Pivot Table Generation w/ Charts. Raw Data processing as well.
*   Reference file: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1L\_U4V1dApz7pTbL1-YCZsEiOK21gMZ68tJPumqNMw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1L_U4V1dApz7pTbL1-YCZsEiOK21gMZ68tJPumqNMw/edit?usp=sharing)
*   Headline: Can a time-limited person use AI tools to assist in coding for standard platforms?
*   Why? George is a self described "Excel monkey" who can create very intricate data tools with Excel. I took over the resourcing roadmap to get ready for the board and found out that I was an Excel monkey too....in the sense that a monkey banging random inputs on Excel could probably get things done faster than I could. Hence, I wanted to see if AI could help out.
    *   Summary: This was born out of George/Alex collaboration on resource tracking tools, namely what could we do w/o resorting to standard COTS software. We were looking to give the PMs a simple interface to deal with and push the coding/integration to us so we reduce the user ask. The end results was several spreadsheets (quasi standard format, differing data classifications) that needed to be tied in together for a holistic view of the company. In essence - raw data → classification of data types/input → pivot table → standard charts and dynamic charts → slicer additions.
    *   Process (intended): "Train" an AI tool to do a standard transformation based on teaching the model to transform various data sets to produce a standard set of pivot tables, charts, and slicers. Note that I did not create a packaged system - I just used my chat history as the 'training' path.
    *   Results:
        *   I discarded Gemini after a couple of tries as the processing time was slooooooow. Gemini also hung up a couple of times while trying to perform transformations.
        *   ChatGPT worked better than I thought. I averaged about 4-5 prompts per transformation at the outset, and then single prompt transformations for updates. The biggest confounding factor was data integrity - one of the spreadsheets was a present day view with dedicated names assigned while the others were forward looking spreadsheets with a mix of names and roles. The present day view was also very Bio-heavy and the forward looking spreadsheets were more holistic. ChatGPT did completely choke on some FTE calculations and hallucinated results - I was able to redirect the app to a recalculation, but it was a definite example of not being able to take ChatGPT at it's word.
    *   Verdict:
        *   Mixed. I'm disappointed in Gemini, but it might be a situation where we need to pay for better data server time. I think ChatGPT did reasonably well for what it was asked to do - it did save time in terms of data transformation and allowed me to skip time in iterating solutions. Overall, I think a better approach would've been a sprint style design in which I did a bit more iterative feature additions, but the goal of this effort was admittedly short sighted and for the board meeting only - i.e. both George and I knew we'd redesign this after the fact for better features.
*   15 min: Challenge teams to use AI - maybe collab with Vidar on presentation tools

# Nov 2025: Madeleine reviews Linear

**Evaluator:** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
**Date:** 6 Nov 2025
**Tool Name:** Linear
**Link:** [https://linear.app/](https://linear.app/)
Private ([https://app.clickup.com/t/868g66kf8](https://app.clickup.com/t/868g66kf8))
**Type:** Product management
**Security Review:** ✅ Approved
**Team / Function:** HW Team project - seeing if this was a potential for PM software
**License Level:** Free
**Pricing:** basic = 10/user/month, business = 16/user/month
**TL;DR Summary:** I tried build product management for DX2 in linear - this may be acceptable for software production but I did not find it sufficient for hardware production.
* * *
## 🎯 1. Purpose & Use Case
**What problem does this tool aim to solve?**
_(Briefly describe your use case and what you hoped it would help with.)_
I was hoping it would be more reliable than clickup in terms of project management software , as the ads seemed promising. Clickup is unreliable / clunky / hard to navigate.
**How did you use it in your workflow?**
I added some "issues" (aka tasks) for upcoming dx2 work in order to see if I like how the information is presented.
* * *
## ⚙️ 2. Evaluation Summary

| Category | Rating (1–5) | Notes / Examples |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Ease of setup & access | 4 | It is not hard to set up, the software is quite simple |
| Ease of use / UX | 4 |  |
| Accuracy / quality of results | 2 | I do not like it for the purpose I set out to use it for. I think for a different purpose it would be better. |
| Speed & responsiveness | 5 |  |
| Integration with existing tools | 3 | Integrates with slack and github but not with clikcup. |
| Collaboration / sharing features | 4 | Seems collaborative like most project management softwares |
| Privacy & data safety | ? | I am not the right person to assess this. |
| Value / cost-benefit | 4 | For the right users this seems like a good tool and not too expensive. |

* * *
## 💬 3. Key Insights
**What worked well?**
_(Features or moments that genuinely helped your work.)_
Nothing genuinely helped my work
**What didn’t work / pain points?**
_(Any blockers, frustrations, or gaps.)_
It doesn't provide enough space / layers for the complexity and interconnectedness of tasks. It is best used for work where tasks can be neatly chunked and there is minimum finish-to-start dependency.
**Any “aha” moments or creative uses?**
_(Unexpected things the tool did well or new workflows it enabled.)_
I like that the "project update" part is just 1 or 2 sentences.
* * *
## 🧩 4. Recommendations
**Would you recommend we explore this tool further?**
*   No — not impactful enough or too risky
    *   I mean, some people may like it for the limited case mentioned above, but it was not high-applicability or workflow-changing. It did not suit my needs.
**Who would benefit most from this tool?**
_(E.g. Scientists, PMs, Engineers, Commercial team, Everyone)_
Product managers who are working on a software or similar project with discrete chunks of work which can be effectively managed at the task-layer and have minimal duration and complexity.
**What next step do you recommend?**
_(E.g. 1-week pilot, training session, skip for now, revisit later, etc.)_
Skip for now.
* * *
## 🔐 5. Security & Privacy Considerations
**Does the tool handle company or customer data?**
_(Y/N, and if yes, what kind?)_
No, it can but in this case it did not
**Any red flags or unclear terms?**

# Nov 2025: Madeleine reviews Zapier

**Evaluator:** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
**Date:** 12 Nov 2025
**Tool Name:** Zapier
**Link:** [https://zapier.com/app/login?next=%2Fapp%2Fhome](https://zapier.com/app/login?next=%2Fapp%2Fhome)
**Type:** Automation (links different software together to automate data from one kicking off an action in another)
**Security Review:** ✅ Approved
**Team / Function:** Automation
**License Level:** Free
**Pricing:** \_\_\_
**TL;DR Summary:**
This could be a great automation tool for "press a button in this software, and something is done in another software" type of integrations. It could be useful for a variety of teams who have repetitive data transfer tasks and in my use case may save 10 minutes per automated task instance (and there are several instances per week of this task).
> “This tool is great for X. It saves ~Y time and is most useful for Z team.”
* * *
## 🎯 1. Purpose & Use Case
**What problem does this tool aim to solve?**
Information distributed across software normally gets manually copied over from one area to the next, which is error prone and time consuming
**How did you use it in your workflow?**
What I attempted to do was make the following:
*   someone posts an issue in #dx2 about a dx2
*   I or anyone else respond with
*   that causes zapier to make an automatic airtable entry in our "incidents" base, so essentially auto-logging the issue

## ⚙️ 2. Evaluation Summary

| Category | Rating (1–5) | Notes / Examples |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Ease of setup & access | 4 | it was surprisingly easy to pair my apps/other software |
| Ease of use / UX | 4 | for an automation tool this was quite seamless |
| Accuracy / quality of results | 3 | the airtable functionality is limited to the point where it is not useful for us for the most part |
| Speed & responsiveness | 5 |  |
| Integration with existing tools | 5 |  |
| Collaboration / sharing features |  |  |
| Privacy & data safety | 3 | Declan said to be cautious |
| Value / cost-benefit | 5 | good wherever automations like this can be made |

* * *
## 💬 3. Key Insights
**What worked well?**

**What didn’t work / pain points?**
Externally synced tables cannot interact with the automation I want to do (aka be automatically populated by a slack post). this is annoying because we would have to adjust the architecture to use this which for now is not feasible
**Any “aha” moments or creative uses?**
I need more time with it, I think if I had a spare hour I would come up with helpful implementations but truly have not had a spare hour for a loooong time :-P
* * *
## 🧩 4. Recommendations
**Would you recommend we explore this tool further?**
*   Maybe — interesting, but needs refinement or a niche use

**Who would benefit most from this tool?**
Anyone who finds themselves learning information in one area and typing it into another area multiple times / week
**What next step do you recommend?**
Revisit the security/privacy aspect and do a demonstration for folks such as in a lunch and learn.
* * *
## 🔐 5. Security & Privacy Considerations
**Does the tool handle company or customer data?**
Yes, it would interact with company data and potentially even customer data

# Dec 2025: Will Reviews Granola.ai

**Evaluator:** [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245)
**Date: 12/4/2025**
**Tool Name:** [**Granola.ai**](http://Granola.ai)
**Link:** [**Granola.ai**](http://Granola.ai)
**Type:** Note-taking assistant
**Security Review:** ✅ Approved
**Team / Function: all**
**License Level: Business pllan**
**Pricing: Free for all users at prolific for 1 year, then $14/user/month**
**TL;DR Summary:**
> [_Granola.ai_](http://Granola.ai) _is a meeting note-taking tool that keeps you focused on the discussion while it captures detailed notes and takeaways for you—especially valuable for PMs, managers, and commercial roles, but helpful for anyone._
* * *
## 🎯 1. Purpose & Use Case
**What problem does this tool aim to solve?**
*   _This tool records_ your meetings and transcribes them without saving the recording .
*   It also has a note-taking feature where you can take notes during the meeting.
*   After the meeting, it uses AI to summarize the transcript and your typed notes
*   It allows you to use templates so that you can record notes in different ways for different types of meetings.
*   It also allows you to chat with your notes to ask specific questions about things that were discussed during the meeting
**How did you use it in your workflow?**
*   I've been using this to take notes for pretty much every meeting for the past four months or so.
*   Recently I started creating meeting templates to get it to do a better job of summarizing notes in different ways for different types of meetings.
*   I have also been taking some online classes and been using this for taking notes from the video lectures, then I'm feeding these notes into ChatGPT to help me study
* * *
## ⚙️ 2. Evaluation Summary

| Category | Rating (1–5)<br>1 = bad | Notes / Examples |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Ease of setup & access | 5 | Super simple to set up, you can start taking notes right away. |
| Ease of use / UX | 4 | It works really well with different meeting platforms. It notifies you when you have a meeting and automatically opens up to the meeting on your calendar to take notes for that meeting. It has folders for organizing your notes. It auto-recognizes when it should move a note into a folder. Uses simple formatting for typing notes. |
| Accuracy / quality of results | 3 | The notes should definitely be reviewed for accuracy. Recording accuracy is not always great, particularly when you're having an in-person meeting with a group of people. It doesn't hear everyone that well/have a hard time distinguishing between different speakers. Sometimes it hallucinates who was speaking. But overall it captures a lot more than I would capture if I were not taking notes or if I were taking notes myself. So it's helpful to capture the high-level bullet points and combine them with the more detailed transcription-based notes. |
| Speed & responsiveness | 5 | Works well, pretty fast at updating. |
| Integration with existing tools | 4 | It would be nice if it integrated directly into Google Docs or ClickUp, but it's easy to copy-paste into other apps. Works great with all meeting platforms. |
| Collaboration / sharing features | 4 | Easy to share links to the notes, or share them directly via Slack, and other people can even chat with your notes transcript. |
| Privacy & data safety | 5 | No concerns here. You can turn off allowing the model to use your data to be trained. |
| Value / cost-benefit | 5 | Seems like great value at $14/month, particularly for people who don't naturally take notes very well during meetings. It can be really hard for people to type and be engaged in a conversation at the same time, so capturing the notes is a huge value add for these types of people. |

* * *
## 💬 3. Key Insights
**What worked well?**
in video calls, especially, it does a great job capturing who's speaking with clear transcription—particularly if people are not in a meeting room and not speaking too quickly. Using this, my class notes have worked incredibly well, particularly with a good template that has clear prompts for what I want Granola to cover. I use ChatGPT to make that pretty easily
**What didn’t work / pain points?**
Some hallucinations. doesn't always capture the key points super well. Needs some nudging in terms of prompting with templates or typing the actual notes out
**Any “aha” moments or creative uses?**
able to watch a video lecture without having to take notes. That enabled me to really focus on what the speaker was saying and not furiously typing and having to pause the video and stuff like that. And then I can just refer back to the notes later
* * *
## 🧩 4. Recommendations
**Would you recommend we explore this tool further?**
*   Yes — worth piloting company-wide
**Who would benefit most from this tool?**
I think managers would benefit a lot because they can meet with their reports one-on-one and capture notes without having to be typing the whole time. PMs, similarly, can really benefit because they can do an even better job of capturing notes than they already do. Folks on the commercial side can also create really good notes with this. I'd be curious to hear about people's experience using Krisp and how this compares to that
**What next step do you recommend?**
compare vs. Crisp and recommend doing a full rollout to the company of one of these tools, maybe an opt-in
* * *
## 🔐 5. Security & Privacy Considerations
**Does the tool handle company or customer data?**
Yes, it handles sensitive data that might be brought up in meetings.
**Any red flags or unclear terms?**
this tool has an enterprise license level which has more secure data restrictions. So I'm curious, what is lacking at the business level

## ⚙️ 2. Evaluation Summary

| Category | Rating (1–5) | Notes / Examples |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Ease of setup & access | 5 | It's super easy to set up. Once it's set up on your computer, you just hold down the Fn key and talk, and it records for you. |
| Ease of use / UX | 4 | Very easy. Not as good on mobile because you have to click a button to switch keyboards, but it's still pretty quick. The only knock on it is that we work in an open office, so people can't always talk to their computers without disturbing others. |
| Accuracy / quality of results | 5 | Super accurate results. Honestly, insanely impressive. |
| Speed & responsiveness | 5 | Really fast, takes only a couple of seconds to transcribe minutes of speech |
| Integration with existing tools | 5 | Great integration. It actually uses context from the app you're working in to change the style of the text that it's outputting. |
| Collaboration / sharing features | 5 | Works with every app I've tried. |
| Privacy & data safety | 4 | Only thing with the pro level is that it doesn't enforce the privacy mode. You need the enterprise level for that. |
| Value / cost-benefit | 4 | I think it's good value. I got it for free for a year because of a newsletter I signed up for. But it really saves a lot of time. It's probably already saved me a few hours. |

## 💬 3. Key Insights
**What worked well?**
when creating custom GPTs, and I want to give a lot of context to it, I have been speaking to my computer to just brain dump a lot of knowledge. And then using ChatGPT to summarize it
**What didn’t work / pain points?**
only pain point is being in the office and not being able to talk to my computer without seeming super weird around everyone or bothering them
**Any “aha” moments or creative uses?**
I think this app would work great for scientists who want to explain what they're doing in the lab so that they don't have to spend so much time typing up their benching entries. They could just give it a stream of consciousness and then use ChatGPT to clean it up
* * *
## 🧩 4. Recommendations
**Would you recommend we explore this tool further?**
*   Maybe — interesting, but needs refinement or a niche use
**Who would benefit most from this tool?**
anyone who's typing a lot would benefit from it. I think especially our scientists and research associates who have to write up Benchling entries and maybe have a tough time finding time to write detailed Benchling entries could speak as they're working in the lab to describe what they've been doing or spend 5-10 minutes at the end of the day talking to their computer or phone about what they did and then using an LLM to structure it better for Benchling notes
**What next step do you recommend?**
would highly recommend other people in this group to try it out and see what they think
* * *
## 🔐 5. Security & Privacy Considerations
**Does the tool handle company or customer data?**
Yes. Anything that you'd be typing is going into it.
**Any red flags or unclear terms?**
pro level does not have ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type II Compliance although it does have private mode

# Nov 2025: Madeleine reviews Zapier

**Evaluator:** [@Madeleine Allen](#user_mention#54136065)
**Date:** 12 Nov 2025
**Tool Name:** Zapier
**Link:** [https://zapier.com/app/login?next=%2Fapp%2Fhome](https://zapier.com/app/login?next=%2Fapp%2Fhome)
**Type:** Automation (links different software together to automate data from one kicking off an action in another)
**Security Review:** ✅ Approved
**Team / Function:** Automation
**License Level:** Free
**Pricing:** \_\_\_
**TL;DR Summary:**
This could be a great automation tool for "press a button in this software, and something is done in another software" type of integrations. It could be useful for a variety of teams who have repetitive data transfer tasks and in my use case may save 10 minutes per automated task instance (and there are several instances per week of this task).
> “This tool is great for X. It saves ~Y time and is most useful for Z team.”
* * *
## 🎯 1. Purpose & Use Case
**What problem does this tool aim to solve?**
Information distributed across software normally gets manually copied over from one area to the next, which is error prone and time consuming
**How did you use it in your workflow?**
What I attempted to do was make the following:
*   someone posts an issue in #dx2 about a dx2
*   I or anyone else respond with
*   that causes zapier to make an automatic airtable entry in our "incidents" base, so essentially auto-logging the issue
* * *
## ⚙️ 2. Evaluation Summary

| Category | Rating (1–5) | Notes / Examples |
| ---| ---| --- |
| Ease of setup & access | 4 | it was surprisingly easy to pair my apps/other software |
| Ease of use / UX | 4 | for an automation tool this was quite seamless |
| Accuracy / quality of results | 3 | the airtable functionality is limited to the point where it is not useful for us for the most part |
| Speed & responsiveness | 5 |  |
| Integration with existing tools | 5 |  |
| Collaboration / sharing features |  |  |
| Privacy & data safety | 3 | Declan said to be cautious |
| Value / cost-benefit | 5 | good wherever automations like this can be made |

* * *
## 💬 3. Key Insights
**What worked well?**

**What didn’t work / pain points?**
Externally synced tables cannot interact with the automation I want to do (aka be automatically populated by a slack post). this is annoying because we would have to adjust the architecture to use this which for now is not feasible
**Any “aha” moments or creative uses?**
I need more time with it, I think if I had a spare hour I would come up with helpful implementations but truly have not had a spare hour for a loooong time :-P
* * *
## 🧩 4. Recommendations
**Would you recommend we explore this tool further?**
*   Maybe — interesting, but needs refinement or a niche use

**Who would benefit most from this tool?**
Anyone who finds themselves learning information in one area and typing it into another area multiple times / week
**What next step do you recommend?**
Revisit the security/privacy aspect and do a demonstration for folks such as in a lunch and learn.
* * *
## 🔐 5. Security & Privacy Considerations
**Does the tool handle company or customer data?**
Yes, it would interact with company data and potentially even customer data
**Any red flags or unclear terms?**

# Nano Banana Pro: Creating an infographic from a  document

**Link:** [**Nano Banana Prompting Guide**](https://dev.to/googleai/nano-banana-pro-prompting-guide-strategies-1h9n)

**Prompt:**

```markdown
Create a whiteboard diagram that will help me understand the content in the attached document: "GAMP 5: A risk-based approach to compliant GxP computerized systems".

The whiteboard should contain diagrams that explain the overall concepts and key details that I should know. Here is context about me and why I need to understand GAMP 5:

I am a bioprocess engineer by training and am leading development of a product that is a next-generation illumination platform designed to bring precise, programmable light control to large-scale bioproduction. Our next generation of  illuminators will be modular, industry-ready system that integrates seamlessly with common single-use bioreactors (SUBs) and enables advanced biological processes that rely on light as a control signal. While the underlying biology can be complex, the mission is simple: deliver a robust, scalable lighting solution that helps customers run more flexible, efficient, and high-performance production processes. We’re now seeking early expert input as we shape the system architecture, requirements, and development plan for GMP-readiness of our illuminator technology.



Take a deep breath and think this through step-by-step.

**Result:**
*   _This prompt produced a text output, even though Nano Banana Pro was turned on - need to prompt it to create the image._
    *   This is a perfect challenge. As a bioprocess engineer developing a complex hardware/software tool for a cGMP environment, you are sitting exactly at the intersection of innovative engineering and rigid regulatory compliance.
    *   GAMP 5 is designed precisely to bridge that gap. It prevents you from having to validate _everything_ with equal intensity, which would stifle innovation and delay launch.
    *   Here is a whiteboard diagram conceptualized for your specific situation as a supplier of a "GMP-ready" illumination platform. It breaks GAMP 5 down into its core philosophy, its operational framework (the V-model), and how your specific technology fits into the classification system.
    *     
        
    *   Whiteboard Diagram: GAMP 5 for Next-Gen Bioprocess Illumination

    *   (Visual Style: Clean whiteboard sketches with blue, black, and red markers. Boxes, arrows, and handwritten notes.)
    *     
        
    *   ZONE 1: THE CORE PHILOSOPHY (The "Why" and the "Filter")
    *     
        
    *   Title: The Risk-Based Approach (Stop trying to validate everything!)
    *   _(Drawing: A large funnel shaped like a filter in the center of this zone.)_
    *   \[Top of Funnel - INPUT\]
    *   Label: All Potential System Functions & Features
    *   (Notes underneath: e.g., GUI colors, user login, precise wavelength timing, intensity reporting, data export, mounting hardware)
    *   \[Middle of Funnel - THE FILTER\]
    *   (Drawing: A sieve inside the funnel labeled with red marker.)
    *   LABEL: GxP Risk Assessment
    *   Crucial Question: Does failure here impact:
    1. Product Quality? (e.g., wrong light ruins the batch metadata)
    2. Patient Safety? (unlikely direct impact here, but downstream effect)
    3. Data Integrity? (e.g., system says it delivered 450nm light, but actually delivered 500nm, and the record is wrong)
    *   \[Bottom of Funnel - OUTPUTS\]
    *   (Drawing: Three distinct buckets caught below the funnel.)
    *   Bucket A (Red - High Risk):
        *   _Examples:_ Wavelength accuracy, intensity control loop, alarm functionality, audit trail logging.
        *   _GAMP Action:_ Rigorous Validation. Formal protocols, negative testing (try to break it).
    *   Bucket B (Blue - Medium Risk):
        *   _Examples:_ User management (standard security), data backup/restore functions.
        *   _GAMP Action:_ Focused Verification. Test based on functional specs.
    *   Bucket C (Black - Low/No GxP Risk):
        *   _Examples:_ GUI aesthetics, operating system basics, physical mounting brackets.
        *   _GAMP Action:_ Good Engineering Practice (GEP). Standard commissioning, vendor testing is enough.
    *     
        
    *   ZONE 2: THE FRAMEWORK (Your Development Roadmap)
    *     
        
    *   Title: The GAMP V-Model Applied to Your Illuminator
    *   _(Drawing: A large "V" shape occupying the center of the whiteboard. Arrows flow down the left side, across the bottom, and up the right side. Horizontal dashed lines connect corresponding left and right levels.)_
    *   \[LEFT SIDE - SPECIFICATION (Down the slope)\]
    4. URS (User Requirement Spec)
        *   _(Note: Written by your Customers, the Biomanufacturers. What must it do for their process?)_
        *   _Example:_ "System must deliver 450nm ±5nm light programmable over a 14-day run integrated with a 500L SUB."
    5. FS (Functional Specification)
        *   _(Note: Written by YOU. How does your product meet the URS?)_
        *   _Example:_ "The software will allow drag-and-drop recipe creation. The hardware will use LED array X with feedback sensor Y."
    6. DS (Design Specification)
        *   _(Note: Deep technical details for your engineers.)_
        *   _Example:_ "Database schema for storing recipes. API calls for bioreactor integration. Circuit board schematic for LED driver."
    *   \[BOTTOM - BUILD\]
    *   System Build & Unit Testing (Developing the hardware/coding modules)
    *   \[RIGHT SIDE - VERIFICATION (Up the slope)\]
    7. (Matches DS) Unit/Module Testing
        *   _Do the individual code functions or circuits work? (GEP)_
    8. (Matches FS) OQ (Operational Qualification)
        *   _Does the assembled system function according to spec in a test environment?_
        *   _Crucial Test:_ Input a complex light recipe. Does the output match exactly, and is it logged correctly?
    9. (Matches URS) PQ (Performance Qualification)
        *   _Does it work reliably in the actual operating environment running a real bioprocess?_
        *   _Note:_ Your Customer usually owns PQ. Your job is to provide a system robust enough to pass it easily.
    *     
        
    *   ZONE 3: CLASSIFICATION & RESPONSIBILITY (Where do you fit?)
    *     
        
    *   Title: Defining Your "GMP-Ready" System
    *   _(Drawing: A layered diagram showing the different parts of your product and who is responsible for validating them according to GAMP software categories.)_
    *   \[Layer 1 - Bottom\]
    *   Hardware & Operating System (e.g., Windows/Linux embedded)
    *   GAMP Category 1 (Infrastructure)
    *   _Validation Effort:_ Very Low. Record versions, ensure standard installation.
    *   _Responsible:_ YOU ensure it's stable.
    *   \[Layer 2 - Middle\]
    *   Your Illuminator Control Software (Standard Product)
    *   GAMP Category 3 (Non-Configured) OR Category 4 (Configured)
    *   _If it runs "out of the box":_ Cat 3. Moderate effort.
    *   _If you configure it heavily for each client site:_ Cat 4. High effort.
    *   _Responsible:_ SHARED. You provide the OQ execution packages and documentation. The customer reviews and approves.
    *   \[Layer 3 - Top\]
    *   The Bioprocess "Light Recipes" (The Programmable Part)
    *   GAMP Category 5 (Custom Applications)
    *   _Note:_ The specific sequence of lights defined by the customer for their specific drug product.
    *   _Validation Effort:_ Very High. This is where the highest process risk lives.
    *   _Responsible:_ THE CUSTOMER. They must validate their specific recipes. _Your system must provide the tools (version control, security) to let them do this easily._
    *     
        
    *   ZONE 4: KEY TAKEAWAYS FOR YOUR ARCHITECTURE TEAM
    *     
        
    *   _(Drawing: A "Post-it Note" style box in the corner with red border.)_
    *   Architectural Requirements for GMP-Readiness:
    10. Data Integrity is King: If the light turned on, the system _must_ generate an uneditable record (audit trail) stating exactly when, what wavelength, and what intensity. If this record is shaky, the product is useless in GMP.
    11. Supplier Leverage: You are a "Supplier." Your customers want to leverage _your_ testing. The better your internal testing documentation (GEP), the less redundant testing they have to do in validation.
    12. Modular Validation: Since your hardware attaches to various SUBs, design your software verification so the core illumination function can be verified independently of the specific bioreactor integration wherever possible.
    13. Configuration Management: You need rigid controls over your hardware and software versions. You cannot silently patch the firmware on a GMP unit in the field.
    *     
        
    *   Deep Breath Summary for the Bioprocess Engineer
    *     
        
    *   Don't view GAMP 5 as a checklist of bureaucracy. View it as a systems engineering methodology focused on reliability and documented evidence.
    *   As the product lead, your biggest contribution to "GMP-Readiness" right now is ensuring your architecture supports Data Integrity (audit trails, security roles) and that your development process uses Risk Assessment to determine testing depth.
    *   You are building the car (Cat 3/4 software + hardware). You need to prove the car drives exactly as specified (OQ). Your customer will drive the car on their specific route (Cat 5 recipes) to prove it gets them to work on time (PQ). Your job is to make sure the car is reliable enough that they don't crash during their commute.

# [IMPROVED] Nano Banana Pro: Creating an infographic from a technical paper

**Prompt 1: (Custom GPT –** [Prompt Maker](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-hhh4w3eov-prompt-maker)**)**

```markdown
create a prompt for an image generator AI LLM. It will take a highly technical research paper as an input and create a detailed, high resolution infographic that explains the key concepts from the paper in a digestible format that uses colors and shapes that are pleasing to the eye, using concepts from "the visual display of quantitative information" as a guide. The infographic should be organized so that high-level concepts can be read first by non-technical audiences, but also explains the details so that technical audiences can also derive value from it.
```

**Result:**

```markdown
Act like an expert multimodal AI that reads complex scientific papers and designs high-resolution, information-dense infographics inspired by Edward Tufte’s “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.”

Objective:
Transform a highly technical research paper (provided by the user) into a single, detailed infographic that is visually pleasing, easy to scan for non-technical audiences, and rich enough in detail for technical readers.

Input:
- The user will paste the full research paper between triple quotes """like this""" or provide a link plus key excerpts.
- The user may optionally specify: target audience emphasis (general / mixed / expert), desired aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, A4 portrait), and intended medium (web, slide, print).

Task (follow these steps internally):
1) Carefully read and understand the paper. Extract:
   - Core question, main contribution, key findings, and practical implications.
   - Essential methods, datasets, variables, and important equations (only those needed for understanding).
2) Define a visual narrative hierarchy:
   - Level 1 (top section): plain-language overview and key takeaway(s) for non-technical readers.
   - Level 2 (middle): conceptual diagrams, process flows, key variables, and main comparisons.
   - Level 3 (bottom or side panels): technical details such as models, equations, data schemas, and nuanced results.
3) Apply Tufte-inspired principles:
   - Maximize data-ink ratio, avoid chartjunk, use small multiples when helpful, align elements precisely, and ensure consistent scales and legends.
4) Design the visual layout:
   - Decide panels, group related concepts, and use arrows, flow lines, and spatial placement to show causality, chronology, or structure.
5) Choose a harmonious, accessible color palette (limited, high contrast, colorblind-friendly), with distinct shapes/icons for categories.
6) Plan typography hierarchy (titles, section headers, labels, annotations) for quick scanning.
7) Internally verify that a non-technical reader can grasp the big picture from Level 1 and that an expert can reconstruct the core method and results from Levels 2–3.

Constraints:
- Output should be a single, coherent infographic image, high resolution, suitable for zooming.
- Think through all steps silently; do not expose your chain-of-thought in text. Directly use it to render the final infographic.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.

Create the Image.
