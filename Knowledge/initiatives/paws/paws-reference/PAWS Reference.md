# PAWS Reference (Working Draft)

## One-minute summary
PAWS (Prolific AI Working Group for Safety/Productivity) is a lightweight, cross-functional working group that helps Prolific Machines adopt AI tools and workflows safely, with clear productivity gains. The group runs small experiments, shares practical learnings, and recommends which tools or practices should scale company-wide.

## Outcomes (Q2 2026 targets)
- 100% of employees report that AI improves their productivity at work.
- 80% of employees report that PAWS helped them use AI more effectively.

## Primary audience
- Now: PAWS members and the ~10 people in `#ai-tips-n-tricks`.
- By Q2 2026: the entire company through broader training and dissemination.

## What PAWS delivers (priority order)
1. Training sessions (lunch-and-learns and hands-on workshops)
2. Playbooks (short, practical guides)
3. Tool evaluations (to decide whether to onboard new tools)

## Why it matters
- Employees already use AI often, but quality, safety, and confidence vary.
- PAWS turns ad hoc experimentation into repeatable, trusted practices.
- A consistent evaluation process helps the company adopt tools that create measurable time savings.

## How we work
- Cadence: 40-minute meeting every 3–4 weeks
- Time commitment: ~1–2+ hours/month per participant
- Core output per cycle: tool evaluations, tips/playbooks, and shared learnings

## Tool evaluation process (lightweight, repeatable)
1. Security review (required for new tools; 1-week turnaround)
2. Try the tool in a real workflow (15–30 minutes)
3. Document insights using the PAWS template (10–20 minutes)
4. Share and discuss in the group; recommend next steps

## Roles and expected contributions
- PAWS members test AI tools in their own workflows and share results.
- The group identifies which tools should be piloted or scaled.
- The lead (you) curates learnings, supports sharing, and runs training sessions.

## Training plan (current intent)
- Mix of lunch-and-learns and hands-on sessions.
- Led by you, with guest demos when members have strong examples.
- Focus on practical workflows with clear time-saving impact.

## Communication channels
- Primary: `#ai-tips-n-tricks` for sharing wins, links, and updates.
- Meeting notes and evaluation docs are stored in the PAWS reference materials.

## Guiding principles
- Privacy first
- Collaborative learning
- Intentional, not impulsive
- Practical over flashy

## Success measurement
- Company survey results against Q2 2026 targets.
- Adoption of playbooks and attendance in training sessions.
- Number of tools evaluated and pilots launched with clear ROI.

## Open questions
- What is the preferred training cadence (monthly vs. bi-monthly), and how should attendance be driven?
- Which teams should be prioritized for early company-wide training rollouts?
