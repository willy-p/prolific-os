# SOP: Drafting, Finalizing, and Signing SOPs

## Purpose
Establish a consistent process for drafting, reviewing, finalizing, and releasing SOPs with GLP-level detail, including associated Benchling experimental templates.

## Scope
Applies to SOPs across CLD, PD, AC, and (tentatively) RD categories, including new SOPs and revisions. SOPs are intended for reproducibility, compliance, and customer-facing readiness.

## Roles
- **Author**: Drafts SOP and Benchling experimental template.
- **Reviewer(s)**: Provide feedback and approval.
- **Quality documentation representative**: Alex Toda (quality oversight). Responsible for PDF conversion, filing, and SOP Index updates.

## SOP Categories and Naming
- **SOP-CLD-###**: Cell Line Development only
- **SOP-PD-###**: Shared CLD and Process Development
- **SOP-AC-###**: Analytical (e.g., Octet, ELISA)
- **SOP-RD-###**: R&D
- **Numbering**: Sequential; no reserved blocks
- **Revisions**:
  - Major: integer increase (e.g., SOP-CLD-001.0 → SOP-CLD-002.0)
  - Minor: decimal increase (e.g., SOP-CLD-001.1 → SOP-CLD-001.2)

## Where SOPs Live
- **Shared drive root**: Prolific Machines > Quality > Documentation > SOPs
- **Folder structure**:
  - **Technical SOPs**
    - **In Revision** (Google Docs drafts and active revisions)
    - **In Use** (approved PDFs only)
  - **R&D SOPs**
  - **Retired** (retired SOP PDFs)
- **SOP Index**: Google Sheet maintained by quality management representatives (Alex Toda, Will Paton)

## When to Draft or Revise an SOP
Draft or revise when:
- A new process/assay/equipment becomes routine.
- A workflow must be repeatable across individuals or teams.
- Work supports GLP-level studies or customer deliverables.
- Steps are safety-critical (biosafety, chemical, equipment hazards).
- A method changes substantially, new reagent/instrument is introduced, or deviations are common.

## Process

### 1) Draft the SOP (Google Docs)
1. **Start from template**: Use the SOP template in the Technical SOPs folder.
2. **Location**: Save draft in the “In Revision” folder.
3. **Access**: If edit access is needed, email Alex Toda.
4. **Revisions**: For existing SOPs, pull from “In Revision.” Google Docs handles version history.

### 2) Review and Approval
1. Send SOP and template to reviewers.
2. Once approved, send proof of approval and documents to Alex Toda.

### 3) Finalization and Release
1. Quality representative converts SOP GDoc to PDF.
2. Quality representative e-signs the SOP PDF.
3. Author counter-signs the SOP PDF.
4. Move the approved PDF into the “In Use” folder.
5. SOP Index updated with:
   - SOP group (CLD/PD/AC/RD)
   - Date
   - Title
   - New version or revision
   - Author
   - Reviewer
   - Description of revisions
   - PDF link (approved SOP)
    - Benchling template link (approved)

## Optional: Benchling Experimental Template
**Purpose**: Streamlined execution guide with required data capture.

**Required structure**:
- **Linked to SOP**: Reference SOP ID and version.
- **Essential steps only**: No background/rationale.
- **Data capture fields**: Lot/catalog numbers, equipment ID, operator initials, results tables.
- **Deviation notes**: Field for real-time deviation recording.

**Drafting process**:
1. Create in Benchling using the approved template format.
2. Share for reviewer comments to align with SOP.
3. Link the finalized template in the SOP document **before** SOP review/approval.

## Retiring SOPs
- Move retired SOP PDFs to the **Retired** folder.
