# Update on SOP Process (For comments/feedback) 

# Context

* During Bio-strategy discussions, it was highlighted that coordination across the Bio teams on SOPs would be valuable. While CLD has been developing v1 drafts of several SOPs, other teams have also been working on their own versions. Bio-strategy has endorsed a collaborative approach to ensure our CLD protocols are aligned and ready for customer-facing use.  
* To support this, I held alignment meetings with Alex Toda (Quality oversight) and technical leads (Max, Kiana, Amritha, Ian) to discuss infrastructure for SOP management. The aim is to establish a consistent framework for writing, updating, and maintaining SOPs across departments.  
* After discussion, it became clear that the most pragmatic approach is to select a process, test it with a few SOPs, and iterate as needed. The following outlines the group’s initial recommendations for a trial run.  
* This trial framework is intended to get us started. Please review and share any comments, concerns, or suggestions for improvement. Some sections will be further developed later once we are over the hurdle of getting the v1 SOPs on paper. 

# First trial 

## Overview:

* **SOPs will be written to meet GLP-level detail and rigor**, ensuring they are sufficiently detailed for reproducibility and compliance.  
* [**SOP template**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M9PEwiomjjpD6MeRdAVJtu-PkWLrBPUO5XyTOhzBrhA/edit?tab=t.0)  
* **SOPs will have an accompanying Benchling experimental template,** which details only the necessary steps to enable the experiment to be carried out,  indicates the information that should be captured in each step  and provides templated results tables.   
* The **quality documentation representative** is  [Alex Toda](mailto:\<alex.toda@prolific-machines.com\>)

## Nomenclature:

* SOPs will be categorized as follows:  
  * **SOP-CLD-\#\#\#**: SOPs exclusive Cell Line Development  
  * **SOP-PD-\#\#\#**: SOPs Shared between CLD and Process Development  
  * **SOP-AC-\#\#\#**: Analytical (including equipment commonly used by biologists, e.g. Octet, ELISA)  
  * **SOP-RD-\#\#\#**: R\&D (confirm if this category should be retained?) 

* SOPs are numbered sequentially (no reserved number blocks).  
* **Major** revisions indicated by an integer increase, e.g. *SOP-CLD-001.0 → SOP-CLD-002.0*.   
* **Minor** revisions indicated by a decimal increase, e.g. *SOP-CLD-001.1 → SOP-CLD-001.2*.

  * [Prolific Machines\>Quailty\>Documentation\>SOPs\>Technical SOPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14gGnKD8xyh7BKZWGaT6Z7bJFSi6Aknmk)  
* SOP Index:  
  * [The SOP index lists all the SOPs.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNoDH9ZOvBbrLdSylLr_cZX2Se9GjUXxc6GGFSi2dlU/edit?usp=drive_link)   
  * The SOP index is maintained by quality management representatives. For now, this is [Alex Toda](mailto:alex.toda@prolific-machines.com) [Will Paton](mailto:will@gaia-labs.com)  
  * SOP index is maintained in Gsheet due to the ability to effectively filter for  “in use” or by “SOP group”, sort in numerical order  and search across all SOPs using key words.   
  * When submitting a new SOP the following information is needed:   
    * Which group does the SOP belong to? (Eg. CLD, PD, AC)   
    * Date  
    * Title  
    * Is it a new version of an existing SOP? Index it appropriately if so.   
    * Author   
    * Reviewer   
    * Description of revisions   
    * Link to PDF once approved   
    * Link to experimental template once approved 

    ## Process for SOP maintenance:

### When to draft an SOP: 

* **New process or assay**: Draft an SOP whenever a new experimental workflow, analytical method, or piece of equipment becomes routine and is likely to be repeated by multiple team members.

* **Cross-team reproducibility**: If a process will be executed by more than one individual or across teams, an SOP ensures consistency and data integrity.  
* **Regulatory or customer-facing work**: Draft an SOP before performing work that contributes to GLP-level studies, customer deliverables, or data that may be reviewed externally.  
* **High-risk or safety-critical steps**: Any process with biosafety, chemical, or equipment hazards must be formalized in an SOP.  
* **Updates or improvements**: Draft or revise an SOP when a method changes substantially, a new reagent or instrument is introduced, or deviations become common enough to warrant a standardized approach.

### Drafting the SOP:

* SOPs are authored in Google Docs (due to collaborative comments, version control, permission control).  
* If drafting a new SOP, use the [SOP template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12X1f60bFpOCFCs0Ocm91xq3ehRSQuNyO/copy) (in the “[Technical SOPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14gGnKD8xyh7BKZWGaT6Z7bJFSi6Aknmk?usp=drive_link)” folder).  
  * Draft SOPs should be stored in the *“[In Revision”](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13yIX65vT14N4NOJM-hQQCD4tgmvbWldd?usp=drive_link)* folder. If you require edit access and do not have it, email the quality documentation representative ([Alex Toda](mailto:alex.toda@prolific-machines.com))   
* If making a revision to an existing SOP, retrieve the SOP from the “[*In Revision*](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13yIX65vT14N4NOJM-hQQCD4tgmvbWldd?usp=drive_link)” folder. Google will automatically create the version control for you. You may edit this document.   
* Send the revised protocol to the reviewers, once approved, the quality documentation manager will create a PDF and log the SOP in the SOP index. 

### Drafting the Experimental Template: 

**Purpose**: The Benchling experimental template is a streamlined version of the SOP, designed to guide execution and ensure required data capture.

**Structure**:

* **Linked to SOP**: The template must reference the SOP ID and version.  
* **Essential steps only**: Include step-by-step instructions necessary for carrying out the procedure, without the background or rationale sections of the SOP.  
* **Data capture fields**: Provide clear placeholders for required metadata (e.g., reagent lot/catalog number, equipment ID, operator initials) and results tables.  
* **Deviation notes**: Include a designated field for recording deviations, to be completed in real time by the operator.

  **Drafting process**:  
1. Create the experimental template in Benchling, using the approved template format.  
2. Share for comments with the SOP reviewers to ensure alignment.  
3. Link the finalized template directly in the SOP document before SOP review/approval.

### Approval & Release:

* \[Later add details on approval process- should it be e-signed?\]   
* Once both the SOP and the experimental template have been reviewed/approved, send proof of approvement and the documents to the quality management representative ([Alex Toda](mailto:alex.toda@prolific-machines.com))   
* The quality management representative will **convert the GDoc to PDF** and save in the *“[In Use](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ti80y7L1kSUuGImSblsSfFsO6hu54nxW?usp=drive_link)”* folder.  
* The quality management representative will update the SOP Index: marking SOP as *“1” (In Use),* linking a PDF of the SOP and the Benchling experimental template. 


### Archiving:

* \[Add detail on archiving\]   
  * Change SOP Index in use column   
  * Move PDF   
  * Change name to ARCHIVE   
  * Etc.
