| From the foundation: This investment will evaluate the feasibility of using optogenetics to control light-inducible expression of mAbs from CHO cells in order to increase space-time yield and reduce the cost of goods. The initial evaluation will likely use Rituximab and Humira as POC mAbs but we would consider using RSM01 or MAM01. From Prolific: The goal of this proposal is to leverage optogenetics to reduce the cost of monoclonal antibody production while achieving superior product quality. Phase I: Cell Line Development  Engineer production cell lines by RMCE into CHO-K1-S ROSABxb1 LP master cell line Complete: 4th week of July Outcome: Cell banked adalimumab production cell lines. Phase II: Small-Scale Fed-Batch CMV Adalimumab Production Set bioprocess in 250 ml bioreactor with CMV Adalimumab production line (2 separate runs for process reproducibility assessment) Complete: 4th week of September      Outcome: Adalimumab from traditional production (CMV) with different fed strategies. Dataset of Humira (adalimumab) critical quality attributes from traditional production using various fed strategies. Process set for small-scale fed-batch traditional production.  Phase III: Small-Scale Fed-Batch Production CMV and Light-inducible Adalimumab 250 ml bioreactor production (2 separate runs for process reproducibility) Test and set light induction conditions Complete: 4th week of November Outcome: Adalimumab from traditional production (CMV) and defined light illumination conditions. Dataset of culture performance using traditional and light illumination production conditions. Dataset of Humira critical quality attributes comparing traditional (CMV) versus defined light illumination production conditions. Process set for scale-up production.  Phase IV: Scale up Fed-Batch Production CMV and Light-inducible Adalimumab 2L bioreactor production (2 separate runs for process reproducibility) Complete: 1st week in March Outcome: Adalimumab from traditional (CMV) and light-induced production for critical quality attribute characterization. Dataset of Humira critical quality attributes comparing traditional (CMV) versus defined light illumination production conditions from 2L cultivation including reproducibility from 2 production runs.  We are in the process of engineering new adalimumab expression vectors to generate stable cell lines in CHO-K1 cells. Tests with our initial cell lines showed that light-inducible expression of adalimumab by EL222 produced considerably less protein than CMV driven expression. As a result, we are engineering a GAVPO light-inducible adalimumab. We’ve successfully employed GAVPO in the production of proteins in CHO cells and its expression level has been shown to be comparable to CMV in HEK293 cells. Additionally, we’ve determined that increasing heavy and light chain gene copy is imperative to increase antibody productivity. We are resolving this issue by employing parallel strategies. First, we are redesigning our constructs to contain multiple copies of heavy and light chain under separate promoters. Our original design contained two copies of light chain and one copy of heavy chain under a single promoter with Furin 2A self-cleaving peptides. Our new design contains four copies of light chain and two copies of heavy chain each under their own promoter. These complex cloning strategies are being utilized to integrate increased copy numbers into our available ROSA landing pad line. Additionally, we are engineering new landing pads in the Hprt1 and Fer1L4 loci in the CHO-K1-S ROSABxb1 LP cell line. Creation of these new landing pads will allow for integration of additional heavy and light chain gene copies into more genomic locations. Both strategies require additional time to generate the necessary cell lines but will allow us the greatest chance of project success. Generating new landing pads would add two additional months to the timeline provided. We anticipate the cloning strategy to increase gene copy number in the ROSA will be successful but have included additional time to generate new cell lines using Hprt1 and/or Fer1L4 integration in addition to the ROSA locus to ensure project success. Monoclonal antibodies are revolutionizing the way we can treat and even cure diseases which is having a profound impact on human health but access to these life-changing therapies is limited to all but the wealthiest of nations. The high cost of manufacturing makes monoclonal antibodies prohibitively expensive to the rest of the developing world. In order to achieve more equitable access innovative biomanufacturing strategies are urgently needed. Optogenetics offers precise, highly tunable control over any biological process and is an extremely promising technology for reducing monoclonal antibody production costs while enhancing product quality.  High antibody productivity is energy-intensive and puts considerable metabolic burden on the cell. Cell proliferation during exponential growth phase of production requires an immense amount of energy and cellular resources for biomass production. Conventional production relies on constitutive antibody expression throughout the production process. Antibody production concurrent with cell proliferation leads to competition for cellular resources resulting in suboptimal productivity and antibody quality. Decoupling growth and production would allow host cell resources to be more efficiently utilized resulting in enhanced productivity and product quality. Additionally, suppressing expression of complex or difficult-to-express (DTE) antibodies during exponential phase would reduce their exhibited inhibition on host cell growth allowing higher cell densities and therefore productivities to be achieved. We have engineered a blue light-inducible adalimumab for proof-of-concept studies. Adalimumab is a humanized IgG1 that inhibits TNFα and is used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Adalimumab was selected for this study as its critical quality attributes are well documented in literature and therefore can be used as a benchmark for assessing the product quality achieved from light-induced production. Light-controlled adalimumab production will be initiated in the stationary phase of production subsequent to cell proliferation to eliminate resource limitations from these competing processes. We will also replicate conventional production of adalimumab driven by the constitutive CMV promoter in parallel to light production to perform a side-by-side assessment of the outcome of both production methods. The expected outcome of light-controlled adalimumab production is increased antibody productivity and reduced antibody heterogeneity.  Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the preferred host for antibody production yet they suffer from inefficient glucose metabolism which results in the consumption of large quantities of glucose and its subsequent conversion to lactate, a cellular waste product that negatively impacts cell growth, culture longevity and antibody glycosylation, which is vital for product quality. Dynamically regulating glucose metabolism to enhance its efficiency would significantly diminish lactate production, extend culture longevity and increase antibody productivity. This can be achieved by controlling the expression of one or more key proteins involved in glucose metabolism. Pyruvate carboxylase (PYC2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. A red light-inducible cytosolic PYC2 has been engineered to divert glucose-derived pyruvate away from lactate production instead converting it to oxaloacetate, a TCA cycle intermediate, that can be used for ATP generation. The expected outcome of PYC2 expression is reduced lactate production, increased cellular energy production and increased culture longevity resulting in enhanced antibody productivity and quality. Malate dehydrogenase (Mdh1) is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxaloacetate to malate. Due to its charge oxaloacetate is unable to pass through the mitochondrial membrane. As such, it is converted to malate in the cytoplasm which is subsequently transported into the mitochondria by the malate-aspartate shuttle. Once in the mitochondria, malate is converted back to oxaloacetate where it is used for energy production in the TCA cycle. A red light-inducible cytosolic Mdh1 is being engineered to enhance conversion of oxaloacetate to malate and increase uptake into the mitochondria. Coexpression of Mdh1 and PYC2 is expected to work synergistically to enhance flux through the TCA cycle and increase antibody productivity. Mitochondrial pyruvate transporters (Mpc1/Mpc2) are required for pyruvate to cross the mitochondrial membrane. Red light-inducible Mpc1/Mpc2 is being engineered to facilitate increased pyruvate uptake into the mitochondria to reduce the cytosolic pool of pyruvate and its conversion to lactate. Coexpression of Mpc1/Mpc2 and PYC2 is expected to have an additive effect to reduce extracellular lactate accumulation while enhancing energy production to increase antibody productivity. Red light induction of PYC2 alone or in combination with Mdh1 or Mpc1/Mpc2 will be temporally activated in the exponential growth phase of production to flexibly rewire glucose metabolism when lactate production dominates over other more productive outcomes.   In addition to inefficient glucose metabolism, secretory bottlenecks in CHO cells have been shown to inhibit optimal antibody productivity, especially for complex and DTE antibodies. Plasma B cells are the body’s natural antibody-producing cells which rapidly produce and secrete antibodies with specific productivities in the range of 200-400 pg/cell/day. When B cells mature into plasma B cells they undergo reprogramming that supports antibody production by expanding endoplasmic reticulum (ER) size and increasing secretory capacity. B lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) is a master regulator of plasma B cell differentiation. BLIMP1 down-regulates genes involved in cell proliferation while activating genes involved in antibody production and ER stress response enabling plasma B cells to become robust antibody-secreting factories. Ectopic expression of BLIMP1 in CHO cells enhances expression of easy- and difficult-to-express antibodies but does so at the cost of cell growth. Constitutive expression of BLIMP1 therefore is undesirable in CHO cell production lines as it negatively impacts maximum cell densities. However, optogenetic activation of BLIMP1 would allow suppression of BLIMP1 expression in exponential growth phase when cells are actively proliferating then activation of BLIMP1 in stationary phase to support increased antibody production and secretion. A blue light-inducible BLIMP1 is being engineered to activate BLIMP1 once maximum cell density is achieved to increase the innate secretory capacity of CHO cells and boost antibody productivity. The expected outcome of BLIMP1 expression is increased antibody titer, cell-specific productivity and culture longevity. A master CHO-K1 cell line has been engineered which contains a Bxb1 landing pad (biallelic) in the ROSA locus to integrate gene expression cassettes via recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. Site-specific genome integration provides stable expression from an active intergenic locus and allows for rapid generation of cell lines. This master cell line will be used to engineer the genetic tools required for this project. Site-specific integration has shown that CHO cells derived by this method display a high degree of homogeneity and therefore can be used as a cell pool rather than requiring further clonal selection. Additionally, Bxb1 integrase has been demonstrated to have extremely high fidelity. As such, the cell lines developed for this project will be FACS-sorted stable cell pools. By controlling adalimumab production (alone or in combination with BLIMP1 activation) under blue light and glucose metabolism (PYC2 activation alone or in combination with Mdh1 or Mpc1/Mpc2) under red light, spectrally distinct optogenetic systems can be multiplexed in the same CHO cell line to maximize antibody productivity and product quality. To rapidly generate the required cell lines gene expression cassettes will be integrated into a single allele of the ROSA locus such that light-inducible adalimumab will be integrated in one allele and a light-inducible metabolic or secretory enhancing transgene will be integrated in the other. While this strategy will speed up cell line development efforts by reducing the need for multiple integration sites it may be possible that gene dosage will not be sufficient to express all proteins at the level required for assessment. To mitigate this possibility cell lines homozygous for each gene expression cassette will be generated as well. In these instances, the transgene’s ability to enhance cell line performance (such as reduced lactate production, increased ATP production, etc.) will be assessed. If the transgene is determined to significantly enhance cell line attributes that would support enhanced productivity a second landing pad (in Hprt1 or another locus) could be engineered to accommodate the need for increased gene dosage of the transgene. Hprt1 and Fer1L4 genomic loci are safe harbor sites which are commonly used in CHO cells to engineer landing pads and stably express antibodies. We have designed strategies to engineer additional landing pads in Hprt1 and Fer1L4 in the CHO-K1-S ROSABxb1 LP cell line. This work is underway. Additionally, multiple elements of the optogenetic gene transcription systems can be further optimized to support increased gene expression such as increasing response element arrays, identifying strong initiator sequences, identifying strong minimal promoter sequences and employing alternative chromatin stabilizing elements. Use of an alternative optogenetic gene transcription system or modifications to the existing systems for adalimumab expression will be determined based on comparative studies of the level of light-induced expression relative to CMV expression. We have previously used EL222 in CHO-K1 cells to express rituximab and now adalimumab. Initial studies with EL222 adalimumab light-induced production resulted in lower levels of expression compared to CMV driven adalimumab production so we are now engineering GAVPO adalimumab. GAVPO is a blue-light inducible optogenetic gene transcription system similar to EL222. We have successfully used it in CHO-K1 cells to drive protein production and it has been demonstrated in HEK293 cells to express at or better than CMV in the literature. GAVPO is owned by the East China University of Science and Technology from whom we are seeking a license. Additionally, we have a group working to test and optimize alternative light-inducible optogenetic gene transcription systems for protein production in CHO and HEK293 cells. They are modifying systems to further increase protein production and fold activation. Their work is on-going and any enhanced systems will be available to this project should they be required.  iLight has been used in HeLa cells, *E. coli* and mice. We anticipate iLight will perform in a similar fashion in CHO cells as has been characterized in HeLa cells. If iLight should underperform in CHO cells an alternative red light-inducible optogenetic system will be employed. A new version of iLight was recently released iLight2, which improves on light-dark fold activation. The improved system will be used in this work. There are no patent filings for iLight2. Additionally, if pertubations being controlled under the same wavelength such as PYC2 and Mdh1 enhance productivity but require considerably different light intensities or duty cycles to achieve optimal results an orthogonal optogenetic system responsive to an alternative wavelength of light could be introduced.  Orthogonal UV and green wavelength optogenetic systems exist but we don’t foresee this being necessary and intend to work with the blue and red wavelength optogenetic gene transcription systems described.  Confirmation of light inducibility of the various transgenes will be determined in 24 or 96-well plates using custom-made Deoxys light illuminators. Initial studies to define optimal light inducible expression will be performed in 250 ml DASbox bioreactors equipped with custom-made Palkia light illumination systems. Eight DASbox bioreactors can be run in parallel to test different light intensities and duty cycles. Antibody titer will be assessed directly from conditioned culture media by bio-layer interferometry using an Octet system equipped with Protein A biosensor. Antibody intact mass will be determined by size exclusion–high-performance liquid chromatography and/or non-reducing SDS-PAGE. One or more light illumination protocols yielding high antibody titer and quality will then be used for production in two-liter BioFlo bioreactors equipped with custom-made Jolteon light illumination systems. Two-liter bioreactors will be employed for fed-batch processing as this scaled-down process can be used to predict process performance at industrial scale. Key performance indicators and critical process parameters will be monitored during bioprocessing to evaluate light-induced antibody production. Nutrient uptake (glucose and glutamine) and metabolite formation (lactate and ammonium) will be determined using a Nova bioanalyzer. pH and partial pressure of CO2 and O2 will also be monitored by Nova bioanalyzer. Total cell density and cell viability will be determined using a NucleoCounter NC-200. Antibody titer will be monitored daily using an Octet system equipped with Protein A biosensor.  For downstream processing, conditioned culture media will be harvested on day 12 of production (or when cell viability is \~75%) and filtered prior to Protein A antibody capture. Protein A bound adalimumab will be acid eluted, neutralized, buffer exchanged then polished by a single cation exchange step. Antibody quality will be assessed by the following: aggregate and fragmentation analysis by size exclusion–high-performance liquid chromatography, charge variant analysis by cation exchange–high-performance liquid chromatography, N-glycan analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of the intact antibody or HILIC-fluorescence and TNFα antigen binding analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Commercially available adalimumab has been purchased to establish assays and will be used as a benchmark. Changes to glucose metabolism via light-induced control of PYC2 alone or in combination with Mdh1 or Mpc1/Mpc2 will be assessed by maximum cell density, cell viability, glucose and glutamine consumption, lactate and ammonium production and mitochondrial membrane potential. Alterations in CHO secretory capacity as a result of light-induced BLIMP1 expression will be determined by ER size expansion, increased cell-specific productivity and increased antibody titer. In addition, due to BLIMP1’s inhibitory effect on cell growth cell density, viability and cell cycle phase progression will be determined.    One of the benefits of using site-specific recombinase-mediated integration over random integration for cell line development is its predictability which ensures phenotypic and genotypic stability. Cell lines produced via this method yield stable expression over generations and don't display genome instability common to random integration. Additionally, the inclusion of ubiquitous chromatin opening elements in the integrated expression cassettes further stabilizes protein expression by preventing promoter silencing. To confirm our engineered cell lines maintain stable expression we will subculture the lines over multiple generations and evaluate protein production. Our organization has recently broadened support for recombinant protein production in CHO cells. As a result, our analytical chemistry capabilities are expanding and will be able to provide technical assistance to this project.  We have also previously discussed working with an established CDMO partner of BMGF and would be open to doing so. In addition, certain equipment previously used exclusively for cultured meat production has been reallocated to support development of recombinant protein production in CHO cells. Our budget for capital equipment costs and personnel has been updated to reflect these recent organizational changes.  Beyond the work outlined in this project, it will be important to demonstrate that optogenetics can scale to industrial bioreactors. Our engineering team is working on illuminator embodiments to realize this goal and can furnish conceptual design and cost estimates for these reactors.  Additionally, upon successfully demonstrating the quality and yield advantage of light-inducible antibody expression over traditional production the optogenetic system will undergo further optimization to enhance productivity and achieve volumetric titers \>10g/L. Protein expression level is affected by the chromosome state where the gene is integrated, gene copy number, and its transcription and translation efficiency. The site of genomic integration has a decisive role in the expression of the antibody and various safe harbor sites have been shown to differ in their ability to produce high gene expression. We are engineering landing pads in multiple safe harbor sites in the CHO genome and will screen those loci for high-level gene expression. Once identified high-expression landing pads will be employed for future cell line engineering to ensure robust, stable antibody expression. Recent studies have shown that gene copy number and configuration can significantly impact antibody expression. Integrating four or five copies of the light (L) and heavy (H) chain in a single landing pad enhances antibody expression severalfold. Additionally, the gene configuration within the integrated expression cassette has a consequential impact on antibody titer. We are currently using two copies of heavy chain and four copies of light chain in an HLL-HLL configuration however alteration of the gene configuration and copy number can be utilized to determine the optimal balance of light and heavy chain expression to maximize antibody titer. In addition, a plateau in antibody productivity has been described when integrating more than five copies of light and heavy chain into a single integration site. However, integration of additional copies into secondary sites can further boost titer, as such future cell line development will utilize an integration strategy into more than one high-expressing landing pad. Further promoters, enhancers, and transcription termination signals significantly impact transcription efficiency and mRNA stability. Optogenetic promoter systems utilize minimal promoters in combination with transcription factor enhancer sequences and the combination of these elements can be refined to increase gene transcription. A dedicated team is currently working to determine optimal configurations of our systems for future use. Efficient translation is also essential for high-yield antibody expression. Optimization of codon usage can improve antibody yield by enhancing translation. In-silico AI-assisted antibody codon optimization can be used to identify high-expressing coding sequences to maximize antibody production. Our team is exploring AI-assisted protein production optimization including closed-loop optogenetic feedback control that automatically adjusts light delivery to enhance protein production based on real-time culture monitoring. Multiple bioprocess changes can also boost antibody productivity. These include custom media and feeds tailored to the unique requirements of a specific production cell line, N-1 seed train intensification to increase bioreactor cell density, sodium butyrate inclusion in the stationary phase to boost protein production, as well as other process modifications. Future production cell line work will employ a combination of precise genome engineering, gene expression cassette optimization and media and process development to successfully achieve \>10g/L productivity. |

### **Beneficiary Overview \-** completed by the foundation

The following section is an explanation from the perspective of your foundation contact regarding the beneficiaries of this work, how the project activities will address the needs of the beneficiaries, and their perspective on why you are uniquely the right organization to achieve the greatest impact through this project.

#### **Beneficiaries –** completed by the foundation

* Who are you doing this work for? The work needs to benefit a specific (and identifiable) group of individuals or organizations that may either be (i) disadvantaged in some way; or (ii) expected to benefit from or utilize project learnings. This group is likely already described in your program strategy documents – leverage and/or briefly summarize relevant portions of those materials as applicable.  

Common examples of these types of groups include:  

* Economically disadvantaged individuals and families (e.g., smallholder farmers, students facing barriers to access or opportunity, poor or low-income populations), or those who otherwise lack access to affordable and necessary goods or services (e.g., vaccines, diagnostic tools, sanitation, financial services, etc.)    
* Individuals impacted by diseases disproportionately affecting the developing world    
* Individuals impacted by a natural or other disaster    
* Policymakers or other influencers who can influence issues relevant to programmatic strategy   
* The public (if educating and informing the public on an area of strategic importance to the foundation)   
* Intermediary organizations who will, in turn, directly reach one or more groups described above (e.g., media/advocacy partners) 

| This investment will benefit the most vulnerable people in low- and middle-income countries by making safe and effective monoclonal antibodies more affordable so they can be used to prevent infectious diseases such as HIV and malaria.  Optogenetic expression of monoclonal antibodies from CHO cells could reduce COGS such that mAbs could be affordable and accessible for use in LMICs to prevent diseases such as malaria, HIV and RSV.   |
| :---- |

* If the proposed grantee would also directly benefit from this work (beyond receiving grant funding) explain why these benefits are inextricably linked to the achievement of the project’s programmatic objectives. For example, there may be no way to develop a new technology, vaccine, agricultural or educational product, etc. without building a new market or expanding the manufacturing or other capabilities of the organization. Benefits to the grantee may include increased customer base, entry (or financial/other de-risking of entry) into new markets, increased revenues, and/or acquisition of significant capital equipment.     
* Additionally, please: (1) indicate whether the proposed grantee would undertake this work in the absence of foundation funding, and/or (2) provide context for why, in the absence of such funding, it would not be incentivized to undertake this work at the scale, or on a timeframe, that the foundation deems necessary to achieve the desired programmatic impact.  Relevant context might include situations where the grantee’s business model or products/services are currently focused on High to Middle Income Countries (HMICs), it believes the foundation’s priority markets are too risky, it needs technical assistance/thought partnership to deliver products to Low to Middle Income Countries (LMICs)or target beneficiaries, etc. 

| The grantee could benefit from this investment as it will help to de-risk a novel technology platform for monoclonal antibody production. This is a necessary and unavoidable benefit as the de-risking and optimization of the technology is inherent to the charitable value of the work. If successful, the new technology could be used to manufacture monoclonal antibodies more affordably which would drive down the cost of goods and make them more accessible and affordable to LMICs.  This could also allow for a higher profit margin in HIC commercial markets.  If the technology is successful, we may consider continuing our investment, and if the technology is brought to commercialization, it would be available to commercial biopharmaceutical manufacturers, potentially resulting in a new line of profit-making business for Prolific. Developing and optimizing optogenetic expression of monoclonal antibodies from CHO cells would benefit Prolific Machines since these technologies can be used to produce mAbs for high income country markets.  However, as they are a small startup focused primarily on meat production, they are unlikely to fully develop the technology to produce mAbs at a lower cost of goods without BMGF funding. |

#### **Project Impact on Beneficiaries –** completed by the foundation

* How will the project activities address the needs of the individuals or organizations for whom you are doing this work?  The link between the activities and these groups should be direct and measurable.  To the extent this can or will be more fully addressed in the Global Access section of the proposal, only a brief explanation should be provided below.  In addition, for “early” work that may inform or lead to subsequent funding opportunities (e.g., planning or “proof of concept” grants, feasibility studies or platform/core research and development projects), why is this investment a necessary first step towards achieving your strategic objectives and programmatic impact on the beneficiaries described above? 

| This grant would fund a feasibility study to determine whether this novel technology could be used to make mAbs with a lower cost of goods. If successful, the new technology could be used to manufacture monoclonal antibodies more affordably which would make them more accessible and affordable to LMICs. Mabs could be used to prevent malaria or HIV. Monoclonal antibodies are highly safe and efficacious drugs used to prevent or treat disease, but they are generally too expensive for use in LMICs.  BMGF and Gates MRI are developing mAbs for the prevention of RSV (RSM01) and malaria (MAM01).  The current predicted cost/dose may prevent these mAbs from broad implementation.  Developing new technologies such as manufacturing with lower COGS could make these mAbs affordable and available to LMICs and prevent diseases in vulnerable populations in the poorest countries.  This grant will fund the development and optimization of the technology to produce adalimumab, an anti-TNFa mAb, as a test article.  If successful, the methods could be readily applied to other mAbs such as RSM01 and MAM01. |

#### **Organizational Fit and Capacity –** completed by the foundation

* How is the proposed grantee uniquely qualified to undertake this project and achieve the foundation’s desired impact?  Does the grantee have the ability to properly track and report on the use of the foundation’s funds?  Your response should describe your assessment of at least the following:    
* The proposed grantee’s experience with projects of similar size and scope;    
* Your knowledge of the grantee’s staff, activities, reputation, and practices; and   
* The proposed grantee’s ability to manage the results of the project (including any intellectual property rights) to achieve the strategic goals (e.g., through publication, licensing to third parties, commercialization, etc.). 

| The grantee has demonstrated success using their optogenetics technology for cultured meat (funded by Gates Breakthrough Ventures) and is now using their unique approach and capabilities to apply the technology to mAb production. They are highly mission aligned and have stated that they want to make this available for use in LMICs and apply to Global Health indications. They do not have prior experience making mAbs and so will benefit from foundation and 3rd party expertise. Prolific Machines has developed technology for cultured meat production to make meat more affordable, and sustainable.  They have been funded by Breakthrough Energy Ventures for this work.  The team is very mission aligned with the goals of the foundation and strongly want to help us prevent morbidity and mortality due to malaria.  They have created a CHO cell line for optogenetic expression of adalimumab (anti-TNFa) as a way of developing and optimizing the technology for lower cost CHO-produced mAbs.  This could help to make mAbs affordable so they can be used for the prevention of diseases such as malaria, HIV and RSV in LMICs.  Prolific appears to be the only company currently trying to use optogenetics for mAb production.  Although they have not produced mAbs before, they have the engineering expertise and scientific background to take on this work. |

**“Outcome”** is the ultimate or overall change(s) in systems, populations, or behaviors that a project seeks to achieve within the time frame of the grant. 

* Describe what success looks like for the project by stating the intended outcome(s) of the project and how they relate to the activities funded by the grant. 

| Outcome 1\. Increase CHO cell metabolic efficiency to enhance antibody productivity and quality. Outcome 2\. Increase CHO cell secretory capacity to boost antibody productivity. Outcome 3\. Enhance CHO cell antibody productivity and quality by light-inducible antibody production.		 Upon successful completion of this project we anticipate generating an optogenetic platform that can enhance CHO cell line productivity of a monoclonal antibody which will reduce the cost of monoclonal antibody production in CHO cells. Additionally, we anticipate that light-controlled antibody production will also reduce antibody heterogeneity and therefore can provide additional cost savings in downstream processing. We anticipate being able to grow cells to a higher cell density by decoupling growth from production using light-induced adalimumab restricted to the stationary phase as well as enhancing glucose metabolism by light-induced pyruvate carboxylase expression during the proliferation phase. It is anticipated that enhancing glucose metabolism and decoupling growth/production may reduce the time required to achieve maximum cell density thereby reaching production earlier than conventional methods. This outcome would result in a reduction of necessary raw materials and therefore additional cost savings.      Goal: demonstrate quality and yield of a monoclonal antibody from the optogenetics CHO cell line which is superior to that from a similarly-derived CHO cell line with a clear path forward and strategy to increase titers beyond current best-in-class performance for CHO cultures which is 10 g/L in a 14-day fed-batch process. |

* How will you ensure affordable and meaningful access to the [Funded Developments](#bookmark=id.3dy6vkm) and [Background Technology](#bookmark=id.17dp8vu), if any?

| We aim to prevent exclusive licenses in therapeutic applications that could threaten meaningful and affordable access in high-impact therapeutic applications for LMICs. In cases where it is necessary to provide exclusivity to prospective partners in order for them to assume the cost of technology adoption, we would aim to limit the time and scope of such exclusivity agreements to maintain our commitment to making this technology affordable and available for use in LMICs or provide affordable products to LMICs. Such exclusivity arrangements are far more likely to be relevant for diseases impacting high-income countries, such as cancer or autoimmune disease, and as such are not going to impact the current mission of the Foundation. In the case that a product manufactured with our optogenetics platform technology has a dual market opportunity in LMICs and HICs, we would negotiate a similar non-exclusive license such that a 3rd party could serve LMICs and provide high impact therapies at an affordable price (which could be a different price than for HICs). Prolific is willing to grant BMGF a non-exclusive license to use this technology for the benefit of LMICs. If this grant project is successful Prolific envisions making the genetics, hardware and software required to produce low-cost antibodies available to  LMIC or HIC partners who are committed to making products that are affordable to LMICs..  It’s anticipated the technology may be used to manufacture in a HIC but the product is made available and affordable to LMICs. Prolific would like the opportunity to negotiate the license should it be found that the product is relevant for diseases that are relevant for patients in HICs, such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Prolific looks to the Foundation to fund the development of the upfront innovation (this grant), modest implementation and engineering, and the likely CDMO vendor will have de minimis software costs that will not pose a barrier to entry or operation. Post development, the cell lines can be made available at reasonable cost-plus structure. Depending on the manufacturer’s’ infrastructure and specifications, the hardware can be engineered and optimized with readily available LED components, using inexpensive unit cost hardware that is already commoditized. Software infrastructure can be designed with a simple interface and pre-programmed for a single product or technical output objective. The CDMO will pay for a modest on-going license fee all of which is designed to produce life-saving therapies at a highly affordable cost. Implementation cost and onsite training will be provided as a modest input that becomes an evergreen asset for implementation cost at a variable that provides a non-amortizable cost for the end user. Prolific will not charge royalties on applications for LMIC public markets  Upon the completion of Phase 1 the Foundation and Prolific will propose and determine the commercial terms to support the Global Health Fund: x% of revenue from Prolific’s HIC markets to be reinvested in Foundation Global Health related projects; provided annual revenue exceeds a minimum reasonable threshold to be agreed on in those markets.  The Foundation will have the option to select 3-5 global health related projects to work with Prolific.  Prolific will provide the Foundation. or its designee with technical transfer of the Funded Developments to support continuing development and/or commercialization if Prolific terminates the Project.  |

The indirect costs include costs associated with administrative tasks such as management, accounting, legal, HR and IT functions, as well as, reporting, tracking and monitoring progress. Additionally Prolific has considered the indirect costs of using shared workspace in its facility. Prolific has allocated the following indirect costs associated with the project: Prolific has estimated the proportion of time that will be associated with resource allocation, tracking, reporting and monitoring progress with leadership to be c.10% of each of the CEO, CTO, Head of Operations and Head of Product time amount to a total of $100,000. Legal: Prolific spends c. $500,000 annually on patent lawyers associated with filing and supporting patent applications. Prolific has allocated c. $100,000 in indirect costs associated with maintaining the patents Prolific has licensed and filed directly associated with this project. Accounting: Prolific outsources its accounting and AP functions spending c. $250,000 annually and estimated that c. 10% of this time will be spent directly on this project over 1 year to a total of $25,000. Human Resources: Human resources expenses are expected to be low given the project will comprise of c. 5% of the FTE time at the company and consequently we have allocated c. $5,000. Facilities: There are direct facilities costs associated with this project expected to comprise of c. 500 sq ft of space at 6.29 per sq ft per month and $1 per sq ft per month utilities comprising c. $44,000 of direct cost. Additionally, there are indirect costs associated with shared working space across Prolific c. 18,000 sq ft of which Prolific anticipates an additional 5% being allocated to this project comprising c. $79,000 across rent and utilities. |

### **Progress Details**

* What progress have you made toward achieving the project's desired outcomes? Describe what you did in this reporting period and what work is planned or anticipated for the next period. 

| High manufacturing costs make monoclonal antibodies prohibitively expensive for the developing world. To address this, innovative biomanufacturing strategies that reduce production costs are urgently needed. Optogenetics, a technique that uses light and genetics to control biological processes, is a promising technology for reducing monoclonal antibody production costs while enhancing product quality. Antibody production is energy-intensive and puts considerable metabolic burden on the host cell. As such, production concurrent with cell proliferation in conventional antibody manufacturing leads to competition for cellular resources resulting in suboptimal antibody productivity and quality. The trade-off between growth and production is well documented, manifesting early in cell line development and continuing through manufacturing. During cell line development slower-growing high-producing cells are overgrown by fast-growing low-producing cells limiting recovery of cells with high specific productivities. Suppressing antibody production during cell line development removes selective pressure exerted on high-producing cells facilitating their recovery.  We have engineered CHO cell lines that produce the monoclonal antibody, adalimumab, under light control or constitutively via the human CMV promoter. We first engineered a biallelic Bxb1 integrase landing pad in the ROSA locus of CHO-K1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. The landing pad cell line was then suspension and media adapted. Our vector design was informed by recent work at Genentech demonstrating monoclonal antibodies can be expressed at specific productivities of 20-50 pg/cell/day by integrating multiple copies of heavy and light chains into a single genomic site ([Carver et al., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9247297/#B11)). We generated antibody expression vectors with a 4:2 ratio of light chain to heavy chain each under its own promoter and a mCherry selection marker under its own promoter for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. Cells were co-transfected with an antibody expression vector and Bxb1 integrase vector then FAC-sorted for mCherry to establish stable cell pools. The generation of cell pools using site-specific integration into the ROSA locus allowed us to perform like-for-like comparisons of blue light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab stable cells to CMV adalimumab stable cells.     To evaluate the ability of optogenetics to precisely control the production of a monoclonal antibody we performed several bench-scale studies with the blue light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab cells and CMV adalimumab cells. To perform these studies, we built custom-made optogenetic illuminators that provide controllable blue light illumination using 405 nm wavelength LEDs. Illumination systems were equipped with heat sinks to maintain local temperature control. The self-contained illumination systems were calibrated to ensure precise light delivery and installed in tissue culture incubators to provide environmental control. Using this system we first determined whether blue light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab cells could produce antibody upon 405 nm light exposure. We tested constant blue light delivery at a range of intensities between 0.1 and 3.2 µW/mm2 over 24 hours. We then assessed internal adalimumab production by flow cytometry and secreted adalimumab in spent media by western blot analysis. There was robust adalimumab production at every light intensity assayed demonstrating the sensitivity of the optogenetic system. Importantly, adalimumab was undetected in control cells maintained in the dark, highlighting the precise control of antibody production via light. Traditional monoclonal antibody manufacturing relies on constitutive antibody production from a strong promoter, of which, the human CMV promoter has typically been used. We compared light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab to CMV adalimumab to determine the strength of the blue light-inducible system to a strong promoter known to drive high antibody production. We illuminated cells at 1 µW/mm2 over 48 hours then assessed secreted adalimumab by western blot. We observed that light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab cells produced 2.2-fold more antibody than CMV adalimumab cells when exposed to light. Additionally, CMV adalimumab cells exposed to light or in the dark produced similar levels of antibody, suggesting exposure to blue light had no significant impact on normal cell function. Having demonstrated the blue light-inducible system could drive higher levels of antibody production relative to the traditionally employed human CMV promoter, we wanted to further test the capabilities of the optogenetic system. The tunability of optogenetics makes it a powerful method to control antibody production and quality. Antibody critical quality attributes are highly dependent on the environmental conditions host cells are exposed to during bioreactor cultivation as well as rate-limiting processes within the host cells themselves. The ability to dynamically control antibody production in response to these factors would enable exceptional control over antibody quality. Optogenetics allows graded or pulsatile expression in response to different light intensities and durations offering nuanced control over constitutive expression. We therefore sought to demonstrate that antibody production could be controlled by modulating the light exposure of light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab cells. We tested 1 µW/mm2 of blue light with varying light patterns over 18 hours. Light was delivered in 1-minute pulses with different time intervals between light delivery ranging from 0 to 60 minutes then secreted adalimumab was assessed by western blot. Antibody production was highly tunable with 10- and 20-minute intervals between light pulses resulting in a 22% and 59% decrease respectively in adalimumab yield versus constant light exposure.  To create a controlled process capable of producing adalimumab with the desired critical quality attributes we graduated our cell line cultivation to bioreactors. To identify essential process parameters for adalimumab production we performed process development studies with the CMV adalimumab cells. We first performed a 10-day fed-batch study in 250 ml DASbox bioreactors to identify optimal media and pH for production. The study design included a 4-day cell growth phase at 37°C then a 6-day production phase at 33°C. Cells were cultivated during the growth phase in HyCell CHO medium supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX and maintained in the same for production or shifted to ActiPro medium supplemented with 1% GlutaMAX. Glucose feed was administered to maintain glucose between 1 g/L and 4 g/L. The study was terminated on day 9 due to significantly lower than expected cell viability. Intracellular adalimumab production was assessed by flow cytometry and revealed antibody production was higher in the initial days of cultivation versus later in production. These results suggested nutrient availability or other potential limiting factors may have hampered successful antibody production.  To rapidly identify factors that could boost cell viability and antibody production we employed the high-throughput ambr15 microbioreactor system. The ambr15 system allowed parallel cultivation of forty-eight 15 ml bioreactors in a single study. Using this system we first investigated whether specific fed supplementation could enhance cell growth and maintain high cell densities. We tested various fed supplements and conditions and determined that L-glutamine supplementation increased cell growth while amino acid supplementation starting day 7 of cultivation was necessary to maintain cell viability. We identified Cell Boost 7a as an effective supplement to replace depleted amino acids during later stages of cultivation. Next, we expanded our study to identify feeds that could enhance antibody production while maintaining high cell viability. We assessed various fed supplements and identified Cellboost 7a and 7b in combination were able to increase adalimumab titer 5-fold over previous studies but unexpectedly lead to a significant decline in cell viability later in production. In our final ambr15 production study the CMV adalimumab cells displayed a significant decline in cell viability early in production in half the bioreactors despite no obvious process failure or contamination. In all we ran three ambr15 studies with 132 bioreactors total to optimize process and feeds to improve cell growth and productivity. Although we demonstrated a 6-fold improvement in titer through process development the cell line’s continued instability and suboptimal performance ultimately necessitated a change in host cell lines. CHO-K1 cells were initially selected for this project as they are one of the most commonly used host cell lines for therapeutic antibody production and are inexpensive to procure, not requiring a commercial license costing tens of thousands of dollars. However, unlike ready-to-use commercial cell lines, CHO-K1 cells require serum free media adaption and suspension adaption which can result in cell line instability. Cell line instability can occur due to the selective pressure cells undergo to survive media and suspension adaptation and manifests as genetic changes, altered physiology, productivity loss and unstable growth characteristics over time. Due to the suboptimal performance of the CMV adalimumab cells we purchased a new host cell line to engineer the light-inducible GAVPO adalimumab and CMV adalimumab in. We selected ExpiCHO-S, a non-engineered subclone isolated from CHO-S cells that grows at exceptionally high cell densities in simplified media and displays enhanced productivity. We continued cell line development in this host cell line while our company explored licensing a CHO GS knockout cell line.   Two separate engineering approaches were pursued in parallel to generate the new cell lines in ExpiCHO-S cells. In the first strategy, a biallelic Bxb1 landing pad was engineered in the ROSA locus of ExpiCHO-S cells via CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering for recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. The resulting cell line ExpiCHO-S ROSABxb1 LP was then co-transfected with an antibody expression vector and Bxb1 integrase vector and FAC-sorted for mCherry to establish stable cell pools. The cell pools are now being screened for adalimumab production and will be utilized for the project if the resulting antibody titers are sufficient to proceed with. A recent study by Szkodny and Lee ([Biotechnol J. 2025](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/biot.202400520)) raised concerns about whether site specific integration into the ROSA locus can support sufficient antibody productivity. In the study a landing pad was engineered in the ROSA locus of CHO-K1 cells then adalimumab or trastuzumab were integrated by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange.  Productivity for each cell line was determined from titers on day 4 of batch production in 24 deep well plates. Specific productivity for adalimumab was 3-fold lower than trastuzumab with both displaying sub pg/cell/day productivity. As a result, we decided to pursue an alternative integration strategy alongside site specific integration in the ROSA locus, should it be necessary to increase antibody titers. In the second strategy, new antibody vectors with a puromycin selection marker were generated for PiggyBac integration in ExpiCHO-S cells. The new antibody vectors contain UAS adalimumab for optogenetics or CMV adalimumab for constitutive expression. The adalimumab vectors were co-transfected with PiggyBac transposase mRNA into an ExpiCHO-S ROSABxb1 LP cell line in which the blue light-inducible transactivator GAVPO was previously randomly integrated. Semi-random integration of the antibody constructs in the ExpiCHO-S ROSABxb1 LP background leaves the ROSA Bxb1 landing pad available for future site-specific integration of light-inducible B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1) or light-inducible pyruvate carboxylase (PYC2). Cell pools are now being generated under puromycin selection and will be screened for adalimumab production using an Octet system equipped with Protein A biosensor. Cell pools will then be expanded for 250 ml DASbox bioreactor studies to compare adalimumab production via light versus conventional production. Adalimumab yield and quality attributes will be assessed to determine whether light-inducible production leads to enhanced antibody productivity and quality. Site specific integration of light-inducible BLIMP1 or light-inducible PYC2 into ExpiCHO-S ROSABxb1 LP CMV adalimumab cells will then facilitate studies investigating whether these light-inducible genetic perturbations can enhance antibody productivity and quality.  We have worked to establish the necessary analytical platforms to report the critical quality attributes of adalimumab achieved by our production process. For the rapid evaluation of adalimumab titer and glycoforms we have implemented a reversed-phase denaturing intact liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method and evaluated Protein A affinity high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (ProA-HPLC-UV), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescence polarization methods. Beyond our intact LC-MS method, we have developed a reverse-phased peptide mapping method for more thorough characterization of post translational modifications. Evaluating method performance of these two mass spectrometry-based methods against well-characterized reference standards has demonstrated we can effectively characterize glycosylation and other post translational modifications of antibodies. We have also established a size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (SEC-HPLC-UV) method for characterization of high and low molecular weight species. In the coming months, we are developing a HPLC-UV method for characterizing charge variants and an orthogonal LC-MS method for the evaluation of released glycans.  |

### **Project Adjustments**

* What adjustments to the project (scope, timeline, resources) have you made over the past period or are you proposing to make?

| While we have demonstrated a yield advantage of optogenetics over traditional production at bench scale, we have experienced a setback in the project due to the suboptimal performance of our adalimumab-producing cell lines in bioreactors. CHO-K1 cells were initially selected as they are one of the most commonly used host cell lines for therapeutic antibody production and do not require a commercial license costing tens of thousands of dollars to procure. However, the cells require serum-free media adaptation and suspension adaptation, which can result in cell line instability. Instability may manifest as genetic changes, altered physiology, productivity loss and unstable growth characteristics over time. The appearance of some of these traits in our adalimumab-producing cell lines necessitated a change in host cell line. We’ve now licensed a commercial CHO GS knockout cell line and propose to use this cell line for the project to demonstrate the benefits of optogenetic biomanufacturing in a robust cell line capable of producing best-in-class titers. Transitioning to an industrially relevant cell line better supports the project aims but will require additional time for cell line development. Therefore, would like to formally request a seven-month cost extension to February 28th, 2026\. We have licensed MilliporeSigma’s CHOZN Derivative, a suspension-adapted CHO-K1 cell line with a mutation in the substrate-binding domain of glutamine synthetase (GS) to facilitate GS selection for cell line development. MilliporeSigma has indicated that the cell line can produce up to 10 g/L with standard fed-batch production. The licensing terms for the cell line have been provided for review. We will integrate the blue light-inducible transactivator, GAVPO, by tol2 transposon into the CHOZN Derivative line to generate an optogenetic expression platform. The top-performing clone with the highest fold activation and lowest basal activity will be selected to engineer the antibody production lines required for the project. We will integrate the GAVPO inducible-UAS antibody expression cassette and the CMV antibody expression cassette via PiggyBac transposase into the optogenetic cell chassis. Integration of the CMV antibody expression cassette into the optogenetic cell chassis maintains the same parental cell line and will facilitate further cell line engineering. Minipools will be generated by glutamine synthetase selection and screened for antibody production. Top antibody-producing minipools will be utilized for the project. If required, clonal isolation from the top-producing minipools will be performed to recover higher productivity clones. Additionally, we would like to propose changing our target antibody from adalimumab to MAM01, as this aligns better with the Foundation’s goal of reducing the cost of production of MAM01. MAM01 yield and quality attributes would be assessed to determine whether light-inducible production can enhance productivity and quality (Aim 1). Integration of GAVPO inducible-UAS BLIMP1 and UAS PYC2 by Sleeping Beauty into the CMV MAM01 cell line would be utilized to evaluate whether these interventions can enhance antibody yield and quality (Aim 2 and 3).    We have hired an experienced cell line development research associate to bolster our cell line engineering activities. This position will provide additional expertise and support to generate essential cell lines necessary to meet the project goals. We would like to request salary support for this FTE and have included it in the proposed budget for the project extension which can be found below. We appreciate your consideration of these proposed amendments to the project, as we believe they will significantly enhance our ability to demonstrate the power of optogenetics in biomanufacturing at industrial relevant titers.

### **Financial Update**

The purpose of this section is to help the foundation understand expenditures in relation to the work performed under this grant during the most recent reporting period and the upcoming one(s). Please provide actual expenditures for past periods and projected expenditures for future periods by updating the Excel budget template and use this narrative document to share additional explanations. Together, this narrative section and Excel budget should provide a complete quantitative and qualitative description of the current financial state of the project.   
For additional instructions, see the [Grant Budgeting & Financial Reporting Detailed Instructions](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/documents/budget_template_instructions.docx).

#### **Latest Period Variance**

**“Latest period variance”** compares expenditures that occurred in the most recent reporting period against the projections that were provided at the beginning of the same period.  See the “Financial Summary & Reporting” sheet in the Excel budget template for the calculated variance (for example, column AD, starting on row 29 for period 1). The budget template also includes an “Analytics” sheet for convenient calculation of variances. 

* Did the project spend more or less than anticipated? At a high level, what are the reasons for spending more or less than projected (such as, programmatic changes, delays in recruitment, etc.)? 

| Period 1 budget was a total of $1,254,802 and actual spend is $697,415, a 44% variance to budget. Period 1 was budgeted with spend for 6 months, beginning in July, however, actual spend did not begin until August, explaining approximately 8% of the variance.  There were no notable programmatic changes and the development work is progressing according to plan. In total, Personnel costs were 28% below budget, capital equipment spend is 100% under budget ($118k) and direct costs have a 52% negative variance from budget.  Additional explanation is provided in the next bullet.  |
| :---- |

* Please provide a detailed explanation for any expense category in which the variance was greater than 10%. This should include an explanation of relevant project decisions or changes to actual costs compared to prior assumptions.

| Personnel costs, 28% below budget, $438,295 actual versus $609,052 budget. The budget assumed reasonable time by specific personnel spread evenly over the 12 month grant period. Due to the nature of the development work, the time required by each individual during the early months of the project was less than what was expected. The amount of effort required by the dedicated team will likely result in bell-curve like trending rather than evenly spread over the time period. This coupled with the salary draw beginning in August rather than July, resulted in personnel spend being under budget.   Capital Equipment, 100% below budget, $0 actual versus $118,000 budget. Our company purchased a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system to support the expansion of our analytical capabilities. This purchase negated the lease of the 1290 Infinity system that was included in the project budget. As such, funds allocated for capital equipment will be reallocated to direct costs during Period 2\. In addition, we would like to request approval to utilize some of the capital equipment allocation to pay 100% of the salary for the new senior research associate who is supporting cell line development for this project. The senior research associate is paid hourly at $63.50/hr or $2,540/wk. We would therefore like to request a total of $45,720 from capital equipment be reallocated to personnel costs.   Direct Costs, 52% below budget, $175,610 actual versus $364,080 budget.  The Direct Costs were spread evenly over the grant period for the purpose of budgeting.  The actual spend will result in higher spend occurring during Period 2 versus Period 1 due to the nature of the development.  Period 2 will require larger volumes of more expensive consumables as the lot sizes will be scaling up to higher volumes. We expect to spend the remaining portion of the budget for direct costs during Period 2\. |

#### **Future Period Projections**

In the Excel budget template, please provide estimated expenditures ("projections") for all future periods of the grant (for example, in the “Financial Summary & Reporting” sheet, after period 1, populate the yellow cells in column T and following). It is important that your projections are realistic and consider the latest plan of activities with updated costs. For example, projections should not just carry forward previously unspent budget amounts into the next period without reassessing expected spending for each future period. In total, the projections should not exceed the total approved grant amount. The budget template’s “Analytics” sheet may be helpful for comparing current to previous projections.   
*Note**:** Over the course of a grant’s life, the foundation may adjust the timing and amounts disbursed to the grantee. This is done to avoid oversized cash balances on grantee bank accounts when spending is slower than originally budgeted. Realistic and up-to-date projections are a crucial input for right-sizing disbursements.* 

* How have your projections for the remaining periods changed compared to your previous projections (from your most recent progress report, or original proposal if this is the first report) and why? Please discuss any project adjustments and shifts in scope, assumptions, timing, decisions etc. which will affect spending. If you had previous discussions with the foundation on changes, please mention. 

| As noted in the explanation from the latest period variances, the budgets were set by spreading expected costs evenly over the grant period. Due to the nature of the development work, and work beginning 1 month later than expected, Period 1 actuals are much less while Period 2 is expected to be much higher.  This will be the case for both personnel costs and direct costs. Period 2 will involve experiments with more complexity and at higher volumes, requiring more time and consumables than Period 1\.  |

### **Supplement Description**

*Note: this section may be pre-populated with your foundation contact's initial draft, please expand upon and/or continue to refine.*

* In this section, please describe what the supplemental funds will be used for, why they are being requested and what the consequence to the project is without them. If the funds support new and/or existing outcomes or outputs, please describe and ensure they are reflected in the Investment Results section below.

As needed, describe any significant risks you foresee by taking on this supplemental work and how you plan to address them.

| We were awarded grant INV-072141 to evaluate optogenetics in monoclonal antibody manufacturing to increase space-time yield and reduce the cost of goods. We would like to formally request an extension for this project. The current project end date is July 31st, 2025\. We would like to request a cost extension to March 31st, 2026\. While we have demonstrated a yield advantage of optogenetics over traditional production at bench scale, we have experienced a setback in the project due to the suboptimal performance of our adalimumab-producing cell lines in bioreactors. CHO-K1 cells were initially selected as they are one of the most commonly used host cell lines for therapeutic antibody production and do not require a commercial license costing tens of thousands of dollars to procure. However, the cells require serum-free media adaptation and suspension adaptation, which can result in cell line instability. Instability may manifest as genetic changes, altered physiology, productivity loss and unstable growth characteristics over time. The appearance of some of these traits in our adalimumab-producing cell lines has necessitated a change in host cell line. We’ve now licensed a commercial CHO GS knockout cell line. We will utilize this cell line for the project to demonstrate the benefits of optogenetic biomanufacturing in a robust cell line capable of producing best-in-class titers. Transitioning to an industrially relevant cell line better supports the project aims but will require additional time for cell line development. Therefore, we would like to request an eight-month extension to the project.  We have licensed MilliporeSigma’s CHOZN Derivative, a suspension-adapted CHO-K1 cell line with a mutation in the substrate-binding domain of glutamine synthetase (GS) to facilitate GS selection for cell line development. MilliporeSigma has indicated that the cell line can produce up to 10 g/L with standard fed-batch production. Work is underway now to integrate the blue light-inducible transactivator, GAVPO, by tol2 transposon into the CHOZN Derivative line to generate an optogenetic expression platform. Clones are currently being screened to identify those with the highest fold activation and lowest basal activity. Two of the best performing clones will be selected to engineer the antibody production lines required for the project. The two clones will vary in their potential activation level based on where the GAVPO transactivator integrated in the genome and the number of copies which integrated which will provide different levels of light-inducible control.  We will integrate the GAVPO inducible-UAS antibody expression cassette and the CMV antibody expression cassette via PiggyBac transposase into the optogenetic GAVPO clones. Integration of the CMV antibody expression cassette into the optogenetic cell chassis maintains the same parental cell line and will facilitate additional cell line engineering. Minipools will be generated by glutamine synthetase selection and screened for antibody production. Top antibody-producing minipools will be utilized for the project. If required, clonal isolation from the top-producing minipools will be performed to recover higher productivity clones.  We propose changing our target antibody from adalimumab to MAM01, as this aligns better with the Foundation’s goal of reducing the cost of production of MAM01. GAVPO inducible-UAS MAM01 and CMV MAM01 constructs are being engineered and will be integrated into the optogenetic GAVPO clones. The top antibody-producing light-inducible and CMV MAM01 minipools will be utilized. MAM01 yield and quality attributes will be assessed to determine whether light-inducible production can enhance productivity and quality (Aim 1). These studies will be performed at different scales including deep well plates, shake flasks and 250 ml bioreactors.  To determine whether light-inducible control of BLIMP1 can enhance CHO secretory capacity to boost antibody yield without inhibiting cell growth GAVPO inducible-UAS BLIMP1 will be integrated into the top antibody-producing CMV MAM01 minipool by Sleeping Beauty (Aim 2). Pools/minipools will be generated by puromycin selection. MAM01 yield and quality will be assessed from the top antibody-producing CMV MAM01 minipool and the top antibody-producing CMV MAM01 minipool with GAVPO inducible-UAS BLIMP1. These studies will be conducted at different scales including deep well plates, shake flasks and/or 250 ml bioreactors.  Lastly, GAVPO inducible-UAS PYC2 will be integrated into the top antibody-producing CMV MAM01 minipool by Sleeping Beauty to assess whether light-controlled expression of exogenous PYC2 can boost antibody productivity (Aim 3). Pools/minipools will be generated by puromycin selection. MAM01 yield and quality will be assessed from the top antibody-producing CMV MAM01 minipool and the top antibody-producing CMV MAM01 minipool with GAVPO inducible-UAS PYC2. These studies will be performed at different scales including deep well plates, TubeSpin bioreactors, shake flasks and/or 250 ml bioreactors. We have hired an experienced cell line development research associate to bolster our cell line engineering activities. This position will provide additional expertise and support to generate essential cell lines necessary to meet the project goals. We would like to request salary support for this FTE and have included it in the proposed budget for the project extension. The additional funds requested for the project extension will support the previously approved salaries of team members as well as the necessary supplies and reagents to execute the work outlined above. Without further funding to the project, we would be unable to furnish results in an industrially relevant cell line which we believe is essential to demonstrate the full capacity of optogenetics in therapeutic biomanufacturing.    Below is the proposed project timeline: Aim 1 \- Enhance CHO cell antibody productivity and quality by light-inducible antibody production Cell line development completion September 2025 Bioprocess development completion December 2025 Production run completion February 2026 Aim 2 \- Increase CHO cell secretory capacity to boost antibody productivity Cell line development completion October 2025 Bioprocess development completion December 2025 Production run completion February 2026 Aim 3 \- Increase CHO cell metabolic efficiency to enhance antibody productivity and quality Cell line development completion November 2025 Bioprocess development completion January 2025 Production run completion March 2026 |

| The outcome of the project is to demonstrate quality and yield of a monoclonal antibody from an optogenetic CHO cell line which is superior to that from a similarly derived traditional CHO cell line. The project outcome will be evaluated by the following questions:  Can optogenetic antibody production enhance antibody productivity versus traditional production methods? To address this MAM01 titer from light-controlled versus traditional production will be monitored during production. Cell-specific productivity will also be determined.   Can optogenetic antibody production enhance product quality? To address this MAM01 quality attributes from light-controlled versus traditional production will be determined. (intact mass,  and glycan profile and functional activity in collaboration with the GHDC at Duke University) from light-controlled versus traditional production will be determined. Can light-inducible antibody production reduce COGS compared to traditional production? To address this the cost associated with light-controlled MAM01 production versus conventional production will be assessed. COGS will be assessed on the following basis: A desired overall yield of MAM01 will be set. COGS ( material and reagent needs for a given fed batch culture) will then be estimated based on either total run duration or number of runs required by each process (light-controlled and traditional).             Skilled personnel trained in molecular biology, cell line development, optogenetics, software development, optogenetic hardware development, bioprocessing, recombinant protein purification and analytical chemistry are required to ensure high-quality data. Specialized scientific equipment including custom built optogenetic systems are also necessary.  |

In answering the questions in this section, please consider all project activities, such as those involving: confidential or protected information (including personally identifiable information or protected health information); the inclusion of children or vulnerable populations; research involving human subjects; clinical trials; post-approval studies; field trials; experimental medicine; provision of medical services (diagnostic, prophylactic or treatment); product development; use of genetically modified organisms, human tissue, animals, radioactive isotopes, pathogenic organisms, recombinant nucleic acids, select agents or toxins, [dual-use technology](https://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Pages/default.aspx), or any substance, organism, or material that is toxic or hazardous; use of aircraft, unmanned vehicle systems, drones or satellites; and the import, export, transfer, approvals, consents, records, data, specimens, images, and materials related to any of the foregoing.      
Please confirm that your organization:

* Will maintain the expertise necessary to conduct, control, manage, and monitor all aspects of the project in compliance with all applicable ethical, legal, regulatory, and safety requirements including applicable international, national, state, local, and institutional, school district or school network standards and policies and is responsible for determining and complying with these requirements and standards; 

* Will not disclose any confidential or protected information to the foundation without obtaining prior written approval from the foundation and all necessary consents to disclose such information;  

* Acknowledges that any activities by the foundation in reviewing documents, providing input or funding does not modify your organization’s responsibility for determining and complying with all applicable ethical, legal, regulatory, and safety requirements for the project in all places; 

* Is a government agency, public institution or multilateral organization or will otherwise maintain insurance coverage sufficient to cover the activities, risks, and potential omissions of the project in accordance with generally-accepted standards and as required by law (for instance, general, professional, clinical trial, product liability, medical malpractice, workers' compensation, or otherwise); and

* Will not transfer any biological materials, chemicals, reagents, hazardous materials, or the like to the foundation.  

\_X\_\_Confirmed     

\_\_\_Not confirmed (please explain)

| N/A |

* Does the project involve human subjects research, as defined by The Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects ([45 C.F.R. § 46](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/revised-common-rule-regulatory-text/index.html#46.102)) (“the Common Rule”), or any other regulated research, including but not limited to, clinical trials, other trials involving human subjects, post-approval studies, field trials of genetically modified organisms, experimental medicine, the provision of medical/health services, surveys, interviews, or focus groups?  

\_X\_\_No     

\_\_\_Yes (please explain)

If yes, please list all approvals and consents required for each site and describe the time frame in which your organization will acquire the necessary approvals and consents.

| N/A |
| :---- |

* If yes, please identify the name of the entity that will be the sponsor/responsible party of any clinical trials, studies involving human subjects, experimental medicine studies, post-approval studies, products, or regulatory filings contemplated by the project.  

*Note: The foundation will not serve as the sponsor/responsible party nor accept delegation of any of these responsibilities. If the project will not involve such activities, please indicate not applicable or N/A below.*

| N/A |
| :---- |

### **Government Engagement**

* Will this project include engaging with governments, government staff and/or encouraging others such as the public or partners to do so? 

\_X\_\_No     

\_\_\_Yes (If “yes” please provide responses to the below)

Engaging with governments, including providing technical assistance, may be considered lobbying under the U.S. federal tax laws as well as under other applicable registration/disclosure rules at a local, state, or national level. 

Explain how the proposed government engagement activities funded by the foundation will comply with the lobbying rules and exceptions as summarized in the foundation’s [Advocacy Guidelines](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/advocacy-guidelines.pdf). 

Your response should demonstrate your understanding of the relevant restrictions and exceptions (*e.g.,* administrative action that does not include legislative activity, non-partisan analysis) as well as how you will manage compliance (*e.g.,* staff and sub-awardee training, legal counsel engagement, tracking staff time, etc.). Simply stating that you are not lobbying or that you are aware of the rules is not sufficient for our documentation. For example, clarify which activities will rely on a lobbying exception (detailed in the [Advocacy Guidelines](https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/advocacy-guidelines.pdf)), or explain why a policy or other dissemination (*e.g.,* social media, sign-on letters) is not direct or grassroots lobbying. In addition, staff whose job duties include directly influencing government policy decisions/actions or advising governments are not solely funded by the foundation.   

| N/A |
| :---- |

* Do you confirm that you will not advocate that a state or local government in California, Massachusetts or New Mexico issue a new regulation, amend an existing regulation, or take similar action that would be considered lobbying in those jurisdictions? 

\_X\_\_Yes

Below, also explain how you will manage compliance within the state or local lobbying rules and exceptions so that foundation funds are not used for lobbying in these jurisdictions, a definition broader than the U.S. federal tax rules noted above. Your response will help the foundation comply with donor required “source of funding” laws in these states.   

| N/A |
| :---- |

### **Election-Related Activities**

Foundation funds may not be used to influence the outcome of any public election, in any country at the national, state, or local level. 

* Describe how foundation funds will be used to support advocacy activities that coincide with campaigns for elective office (e.g., voter education, polling or surveys, engagement with a candidate or parties), consistent with U.S. and any additional local rules which may apply.
