# BMGF Grant Alignment Summary (MAM01 Focus, for Kiana)

## Purpose and strategic fit (from grant)
- Charitable purpose: use optogenetics in mAb manufacturing to reduce COGS and improve access in LMICs.
- Strategic fit: evaluate feasibility of optogenetics to control light-inducible mAb expression in CHO cells to increase space-time yield and reduce cost of goods.
- Internal goal statement in proposal: reduce cost of mAb production while achieving superior product quality.

## Project outcomes and success criteria (MAM01 framing)
- Outcome 1: Increase CHO cell metabolic efficiency to enhance antibody productivity and quality.
- Outcome 2: Increase CHO cell secretory capacity to boost antibody productivity.
- Outcome 3: Enhance CHO cell antibody productivity and quality by light-inducible antibody production.
- Stated goal: demonstrate quality and yield of a mAb from optogenetic CHO line that is superior to a similarly derived CHO line, with a clear path to titers >10 g/L (14-day fed-batch best-in-class).
- For reporting, treat MAM01 as the primary test article and ensure all outputs and evaluations are tied to MAM01 unless explicitly labeled as legacy adalimumab context.

## Deliverables and outputs (original grant)
- Light-responsive CHO-K1 cell lines for light-inducible mAb expression.
- Comprehensive CQA assessment comparing optogenetic vs traditional production in 2 L bioreactors.
- Characterization of opto mAb cell lines including stability over multiple passages.

## Measurement and evaluation (MAM01 focus)
Evaluation questions and measures to deliver:
- Productivity vs traditional: MAM01 titer and cell-specific productivity.
- Product quality vs traditional: MAM01 intact mass, glycan profile, and functional activity (with GHDC at Duke).
- COGS impact: cost per desired MAM01 yield based on run duration and/or number of runs.

## Out-of-scope clarification
The long section about industrial-scale bioreactors, landing pad expansion, gene copy number optimization, promoter/enhancer optimization, and AI-assisted feedback control is described as beyond this project. That content should be treated as future optimization and scale-up, not grant scope. The grant’s core scope is feasibility and comparative performance at lab-scale with defined outputs.

## Alignment questions to resolve with Kiana
- Are we aligning strictly to an apples-to-apples comparison within the same optogenetic background (primary goal)?
- Do we still want the later comparison of best opto line vs best CMV line (real-world performance), and if so, is it positioned as supplemental or post-grant?
- Do we need a formal note in the report narrative to document the shift to MAM01 as the primary test article?

## MAM01 deliverables to share at the end (minimum set)
- Comparative productivity: MAM01 titer timecourses and cell-specific productivity for opto vs traditional.
- Comparative quality: MAM01 intact mass, glycan profile, and functional activity (GHDC collaboration).
- COGS comparison: cost per desired MAM01 yield based on run duration and/or number of runs.
- Cell line stability over passages (if completed).
- Summary of opto vs traditional process conditions, including run reproducibility.
- Datasets referenced in the grant data access section (sequencing, chromatograms, ELISA, mass spec, etc.).

## Budget and spend-down focus (next 3 months)
- Current priority: spend down direct costs tied to planned wet-lab runs (consumables, reagents, analytics, tissue culture media) and required software licenses.
- Personnel costs were under budget in Period 1 due to ramp timing and bell-curve effort; higher draw is expected in the remaining period as scale-up work ramps.
- Capital equipment variance: funds can be reallocated to direct costs and/or personnel (per request to cover senior research associate time).
- Make sure all software licenses are captured (science and engineering stacks) and mapped to the budget line items already described.

## Open risks and framing
- Main risk: scope drift relative to foundation expectations. Mitigation: keep narrative as natural evolution, stay anchored to feasibility and comparative performance.
- Global access alignment: continue to emphasize cost-of-goods reduction and LMIC access as primary rationale.

## Notes from today’s alignment (from Will)
"Hi @Victor @Kiana – Wanted to capture where we landed so we’re all on the same page.
What we aligned on:
Two(ish) goals:
We will do as direct a comparison compare as apples-to-apples as possible (i.e. comparison in the same opto-containing background)
Maybe: Compare best opto line to best CMV line (real-world performance over apples-to-apples genetic matching) - this will happen later, so need to determine whether this makes sense.
Next steps:
Will + Kiana: Read through the full grant agreement for additional context
Will + Kiana: Draft a goal proposal slide (prioritized goals and rationale) outlining the approach and where it deviates from previous understanding
Kiana: Validate with biostrategy (add to agenda), then communicate to the broader team as our North Star
Kiana: Frame this as natural project evolution when presenting to foundation
Victor: Follow up on the Gates Strategic Investment Fund / RSV opportunity with leadership (loop in Deniz asap)
Main risk we flagged: Making sure our approach doesn’t conflict with foundation expectations. Plan is to get internal alignment first, then present to foundation as evolution rather than pivot. Let me know if I missed anything or captured something wrong."
