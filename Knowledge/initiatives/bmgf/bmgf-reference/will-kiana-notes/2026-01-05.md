# Granola Notes
## Kiana / Will

Mon, 05 Jan 26 · JellyBelly-2-Mid Mezz.-Green Apple (4), kiana.mohajeri@prolific-machines.com

### Top of mind

- Consolidating BMGF project meetings (lab users and data dissemination meetings) into a weekly stand-up format
    
    - Goal is to eliminate inefficiencies where entire group was held captive for discussions relevant to only a few people
        
    - Planning to use Green Apple project meeting structure as template
        
    - Max needs to attend since Gates Foundation expects both Will and Max to be present in foundation meetings
        
- Immediate priorities for this week include reorienting the team after break and establishing what experiments should start next week
    
    - Using this week as buffer week rather than rushing into new experiments
        
    - Need baseline understanding of current status from all team members
        

### Updates and wins

- Successfully took ownership of BMGF meeting from Sasha, who was accommodating about the transition
    
- Green Apple project is well-established and running smoothly, providing good template for BMGF structure
    
- Team structure changes going well - John R now reports directly to Will
    
- Legal review of BMGF confidentiality questions initiated through Curtis (new legal counsel)
    

### Challenges and blockers

- Data deck participation remains inconsistent
    
    - Team members not adding experiment results regularly
        
    - When people do add content, often too detailed (6+ slides) instead of distilled key takeaways
        
    - Sasha generates significant data but struggles to synthesize conclusions before moving to next experiment
        
    - Basanta split between CLD and BMGF projects, delivering more for CLD
        
- John R lacks data analysis skills needed for his role progression
    
    - Previously relied on Nessa for analysis work
        
    - Will committed to working with him on developing these capabilities
        
- Gates Foundation meeting timing unclear
    
    - Tara supposed to help with scheduling but no response yet
        
    - Dennis out this week, can’t get clarity until he returns
        
- Time card requirements seem unnecessary but mandated by Gates Foundation
    
    - Takes 45-60 minutes monthly
        
    - Unclear if foundation actually reviews them
        
    - Current approach: allocate hours to match agreed percentage commitments
        

### Mutual feedback

- Will asked Kiana to flag if she sees tasks he’s doing that she could handle instead
    
- Kiana offered to join Will’s meetings for note-taking support if helpful as he establishes baseline processes
    
- Agreement that both should gather information on cell line status rather than just one person to ensure thoroughness
    

### Action Items

- **Kiana**: Send DMs to team members for status updates (instead of channel posts to avoid pressure)
    
    - Check with Amritha, John R, and Basanta on current work status
        
    - Include Will on communications
        
- **Will**: Create meeting agenda template based on Green Apple structure
    
    - Add Max, Shahram, Amritha, and Nora to Wednesday meeting
        
    - Convert bi-weekly team meeting to weekly stand-up format
        
    - Give Sasha heads up about meeting consolidation before making changes
        
- **Both**: Touch base tomorrow afternoon to compare notes on team status
    
    - Goal: Have clear sense of prioritized experiments for following week by end of this week
        
- **Will**: Review budget information from Christina before tomorrow’s meeting
    
    - Understand spending status on additional $1.2M and overall grant
        
    - Plan to spend remaining funds on items usable beyond March deadline
        
- **Will**: Create outline for Gates Foundation presentation deck by end of week
    
    - Timeline depends on when meeting is scheduled
        
- **Will**: Follow up with Dennis when he returns about Gates meeting timing
    
- **Both**: Ask Christina tomorrow about Brex expenses and whether BMGF purchases need separate payment processing
