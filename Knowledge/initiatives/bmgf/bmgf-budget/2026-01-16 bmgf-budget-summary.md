# 2026-01-16 BMGF Budget Summary 

This document's purpose is to outline the errors that I have found in the November 2025 invoice from Engine Room, as well as to categorize where we stand in relation to the BMGF budget. As of today, January 16th, 2026.

Here are notes that I took earlier in the week.
Gates Budgeting


Monthly charges
- 
way underspent in 2024 everywhere:
Period 1 budget was a total of $1,254,802 and actual spend is $697,415, a 44% variance to budget. Period 1 was budgeted with spend for 6 months, beginning in July, however, actual spend did not begin until August, explaining approximately 8% of the variance.  There were no notable programmatic changes and the development work is progressing according to plan. In total, Personnel costs were 28% below budget, capital equipment spend is 100% under budget ($118k) and direct costs have a 52% negative variance from budget.  Additional explanation is provided in the next bullet.

Personnel costs, 28% below budget, $438,295 actual versus $609,052 budget. The budget assumed reasonable time by specific personnel spread evenly over the 12 month grant period. Due to the nature of the development work, the time required by each individual during the early months of the project was less than what was expected. The amount of effort required by the dedicated team will likely result in bell-curve like trending rather than evenly spread over the time period. This coupled with the salary draw beginning in August rather than July, resulted in personnel spend being under budget.  

Capital Equipment, 100% below budget, $0 actual versus $118,000 budget. Our company purchased a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system to support the expansion of our analytical capabilities. This purchase negated the lease of the 1290 Infinity system that was included in the project budget. As such, funds allocated for capital equipment will be reallocated to direct costs during Period 2. In addition, we would like to request approval to utilize some of the capital equipment allocation to pay 100% of the salary for the new senior research associate who is supporting cell line development for this project. The senior research associate is paid hourly at $63.50/hr or $2,540/wk. We would therefore like to request a total of $45,720 from capital equipment be reallocated to personnel costs.  

Direct Costs, 52% below budget, $175,610 actual versus $364,080 budget.  The Direct Costs were spread evenly over the grant period for the purpose of budgeting.  The actual spend will result in higher spend occurring during Period 2 versus Period 1 due to the nature of the development.  Period 2 will require larger volumes of more expensive consumables as the lot sizes will be scaling up to higher volumes. We expect to spend the remaining portion of the budget for direct costs during Period 2.

there was a request to spend the $118k that was allocated for capex on John R’s salary. but we didn’t use that and were still under on personnel by about 10% in 2025 (33k)

we were about 3% over budget on consumables between 2024-2025. about 60% over in 2025 ($212,129) but under budget in 2024.

Engine Room is putting John R under direct costs. they should do it as personnel.


How is forkable allocation calculated??

How is R&D consumables allocation calculated??

Engine room made some errors in 2025.
- John R was included in direct costs, not in Personnel
- In the 9/25 report they billed all of our consultants against the grant, not just John R
    - This was 34,981.25 (42760-7,778.75)
- double-counted wages in 1/25 (in both 1/25 and 2/25)

John's wages were lower in Sep and Oct
- Periods ending in 9/7, 9/14, 9/21, 10/5, 10/12, 10/19. 
Looks like we're missing John's wages from 9/28 and 10/26. Also ending 11/30 (unless that will be captured in December).

I am creating a new file called `2026-01-16 ER Nov 2025 Gates Invoice - WP corrections` which is a copy of Engine Room's 2025 November invoice but with corrections made to all those errors.

Forkable allocation has been categorized as other direct costs, and I think we should move it to personnel. Forkable is also only doing therapeutics R&D for the allocations. I'm not sure how the forkable allocation should be done, but I think it could be based off of the people working on the project.
Therapeutics R&D only spent $2,546 from April 2025 through September 2025. That's 2% of what the company spent during that amount of time. So I think that we can bump it up a bit because there were more people than just Therapeutics R&D working on the project, and they were getting Forkable lunches and that should be included in personnel.

When I finished on Friday, I was adding up the totals for the remaining budget for personnel fringe benefits and John R as well as all the other costs and how much spend we were doing on average per month. And kind of extrapolating that out through the end of March. And seeing how much we have left. Looks like it's about $626,000 actually which is a ton of money. 

Next steps:
1. Confirm that these calculations are accurate
2. Check if I need to make any other adjustments
3. Share with Christina
4. Develop proposal for next steps
