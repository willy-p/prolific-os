# 20241107 BMGF timeline meeting

Attendees: Alex, Nessa, Sasha, Mon

Alex: End gate 2L. Schedule had a lot of buffer. Concerned time is being lopped off front. Cells not performing. Contamination issue with GAVPO. CMV line is not performing well.
Nessa: CHO cells in this facility are not behaving.
Alex: because we haven't had a successful 250ml. Handoffs also uncertain. Do we need to think about this differently? Should Sasha do additional analytics? Do we need to streamline what we are doing - fewer lines. What do we need to re-imagine about the schedule. How set in stone is the deadline with BMGF?
Nessa: End date is the 31st July. Cell lines are dying and changing DT in wider context. Can't FACS etc. Instead of recovering taking weeks to recover. Makes sense to back off ambitious timelines.

Sasha: Bottlenecks in bio team. Oscar is the bottleneck, doing all FACS.

Nessa: Not getting integration into landing pads, expanding conditions, even more FACS.
LP trying serial dilution.

Victor to hold meeting on cell line death and FACS.

GAVPO not shear sensitive but CMV HET Is (it is bulk). They are currently recovering and can do stability test to get good doubling time before handing off.

Sasha: do you think HOM will be in Dec.
Nessa: **on sat will know if recover HOM lines.** Need to age out cells and see GFP decline but currently still GFP positive. Nessa engineered a new construct to deliver integrase. Max's and Johns team haven't been able to integrate anything.
Opto team have the Expi CHO line that has LP but its a bulk population.

Nessa idea for Sasha:
*   pull out the parental line, make sure the DT is stable over time.
*   Characterization of HOM lines.
*   Have HET CMV and GAVPO bulk lines and should be behaving relatively well. 98% purity.
    *   Cells are huge 18.5 rather than 14.
    *   No osmolarity issue.
    *   DT
*   no process dev until January.

BMGF - nessa is trickle feeding adherent data. They are keen on project and nessa will submit a progress report at end of the year. No extra funding until POC. Wiggle room in 2L vs smaller (250ml etc).

Alex: take more time with CMV Ambr 15 and shake flask.
Nessa: take time to understand the heterozygous lines. These lines will be used for BMGF line.
Sasha: looking at 4-6 cell lines. We can realistically in 6 months getting maybe 3-4 where its repeatable dataset.
Nessa: can show some small POC. For PYC and PRDM1beta, slightly specific for the stage the cells are growing (eg stationary) can mimic though.

Nessa: PRDM1 is more interesting to BD at prolific. Also less major effect on cell.

Actions for Sasha :
*   do dev on HET CMV and GAVPO (focus on CMV first).
    *   PRDM1 will be fed into the HET line and will be next most important cell line.
*   Focus on robust handoffs rather than dates.
*   Talk to John about assays to understand where protein production is being screwed.
*   Make a slide.

# 20241119

Q: Will we be scaling up to 2L or will you suggest smaller volumes?
*       *   want to do for PRDM1.
Q: How did the making of the HOM lines go?
*       *   in the process of being sorted.
Q: Which cell lines are currently being made?
*       *   DT?
    *   Morphology?
Q: Do you still plan to do both PRDM1 and PYC?

Attendees: Nessa, Ian, Alex, Nur, Sasha, Oscar, Victor, Brenna, Monique

Notes:
Hopefully the goals and deliverables for the Gates foundation are aligned.  

The grant outcomes (slide 3) are not just the deliverables.  As an example, analytical there are additional things which are listed.  The Therapeutics charter is better to reference.  @nessa will post the charter onto the BMGF will put the charter onto the slack channel for review.  Sometime the wording gets confusing for grants and Nessa can structure specific deliverables that can be shared.  Mon- Each deliverable needs a piece of data correct?  Nessa- Yes!  For grant funding there are multiple aims and they can be independent of each other.  There are three aims, they are independent of each other so if one research thread is not successful then other aims can still progress.  

What is listed in #1- goals/project deliverables has been updated by Nessa and is accurate.  They mostly care about the outcome (eg. 250mL vs 2L might not matter).  
Alex- With everything that is going on with other projects, and we expect there will be some flexibility.  Lets be very clear about what we can and cannot let go.  We have 7 months left, need to get data.  
Ian- With going down in scale makes sense we may not produce sufficient material to do all assays.  Suggestions to put together prioritized list.  

Mon- Leadership and commercial need to be clear.  Victor- Yes this is clear to me.  Mon- will discuss with Vidar.  Sara- will communicate with Maria.  

Ideally- getting hundreds of mg of >95% purity material.  

Nessa wants to reinforce this is early scale experiment.  Alex still wants to reserve the right to be scared about the low production.  Alex agree to a point, and we’ve built timelines with best case scenario and we likely need to additional development to get it to work.  Nessa is expecting that the CMV, homo cell line should deliver higher performance. 

We should not expect linear relationship with the number of copies.  Sashe wants to reinforce that we may have multiple bottlenecks that likely need addressing.  How are we thinking about where will spend resources on development and bio.  

Is there a minimum titer that we need to hit-  Sasha- .3-0.4mg/L with 4 vessels, assuming 80% recovery.  Ian and Nessa to follow up on the minimum amount of material for minimal quality characterization.  

How many days do you need to prep the final report?  Not sure, fairly certain there is some flex in final report delivery.  20 days per run for execution and data analysis.

Cell line characterizations- some sense of the titer before handover.  Yes there will be more characterization for actual cell line assessment before handoff. 

BMGF were interested in characterization of the pool stability.  Sasha- will you have the bandwidth to do additional cell line characterization?  Nessa- Yes.  

Priority for us would be BLMP1 since it aligns with broader R&D strategy, however delivering any of these aims is a successful grant outcome.  

300 mg of 96% pure mAb required for full CoA
* * *

Minimum titer for full CoA:
300 mg final delivery 
80% recovery from DSP = 360 mg input
Titer for 1x 250 mL = 1.44 g/L → divided by 4 for total of 8 Das boxes (CMV vs. GAVPO) = **0.36 g/L final titer**

* * *

Risks:
We only have GAVPO right now, we don’t know whether it’s strong enough

Twice the resources for the P1.2 integration step

Need a lot of copies of antibody so putting in at the same time. 

We have additional bio engineering strategies being explored in addition to process development with BPD, so multiple threads.  Only one cell line (CMV and GAVPO) will be delivered to BPD. And there is one additional cell line BLMP1 that would feed in.  Bio strategy is implementing these bio screens in CMV background.  

Will the ambr15 be a resource constraint?  This is likely the case.  

What would BPD want to see for graduation from Bio to BPD?  Eg. Metabolic profiles are easily completed with the AMBR15.  There may be a likely scenario that we need an ambr15.  

Alex- suggestions to put a hypothetical framework and identify what the rate limiter within the whole workflow would be.  Scenario plan what we would do to address these. 
* * *
Analytical will need to make tradeoffs if investment case is not supported. Ian is working on investment case.  

Alex-  Does that foundational bio work not result in us delivering on needed org outcomes.  Nessa- we have some early derisking work done here.  We have multiple cell line engineering approaches to address these risks.  There are technical efforts outside of this project that would address any base bio limits.  

From a leadership perspective how important is it to get to success for this project?  Ideally we get the malaria biologic from them.  The gates foundation has a large name and could impact fundraising outcomes.  There could be a scenario where we illustrate this data from another project, we’d have to be thoughtful about what we share with them.  Of course data outside this project, if successful, would be compelling.  Ideally the relationship would expand.  

If we wanted to discuss an extension we can have that conversation in the future.  We are 6 months in, so would be a future conversation with the gates foundation. 
* * *
**Summary of alignments so far (because Mon likes it in writing):**
*   1 cell line each from CMV Humira, GAVPO Humira, GAVPO PRDM1beta, light inducible PYC will be chosen for further study.
*   If prioritization on cell line promotion to BPD needs to happen, the GAVPO Humira and PRDM1beta strategies overlap most with the company strategy and are priority. Nessa's team/Nessa working with the BMGF will assess the outcomes of any cell lines that the company does not have bandwith to promote to BPD/Analytics.
*   Victor on behalf of leadership, Sara on behalf of commercial, Mon on behalf of product have acknowledged that this data is not meant to deliver industry relevant titers, but instead provides relative comparisons for each dataset. This was baked into the design of the cell lines from the beginning (using LP and 1 integration).

**Action items**
[@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556):
*   Post a summary of the deliverables for the project on the BMGF slack (as it is nuanced when compared to lifting from grant).
*   Provide a prioritized CQA list (from the perspective of what the BMGF would like to see)
*   Work on the data package that will be produced - [@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201) happy to help here if useful?
*   Work with Sasha on streamlining CLD handoff - eg translatable titer measurement.

[@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532)
*   Provide a CQA list and the minimum amounts you would require to run the tests. Indicate if the tests overlap with what you are developing for the rest of the company.
*   Given the minimum quality characterization, what is the minimum titer you require from a production run?
*   Maintain a pulse on analytics throughput plans for biology for 2025 to make case for additional hires.

[@Monique Hooley](#user_mention#54096201)
*   Follow up with John, Max and Kiana about throughput for Ambr15 and analytics to identify bottlenecks and whether there is a business case for an additional Ambr15 and additional analytics team members.
*   Follow up with Vidar about relative titer being the goal of this project

[@Victor Jones](#user_mention#54153244)
*   Ensure leadership are aware that relative titer is the goal of this project, not industry relevant titers
*   Check in with leadership. How important is success in the BMGF for our company/reputation. Information to align resources with importance. If it came to it, would we share data/the fact that we have pursued other bio strategies to get light inducible mAb production in order to unlock further investment.

[@Sara Kemppainen](#user_mention#75390516)
*   Ensure commercial are aware that relative titer is the goal of this project, not industry relevant titers (industry relevant will not be possible with this engineering approach. The engineering approach taken gives better side by side comparison as copy number and integration location are taken into consideration).

[@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   Work with Nessa on streamlining CLD handoff - eg translatable titer measurement.

# 20250130

**Agenda**
*   Discuss [BMGF project timeline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wZwa-agouWLs93xUWnMMEQgNAwvEe4U3-qzSq7XOaUI/edit) and get feedback regarding resources
*   Gates foundation available analytic assistance- waiting on response from foundation
*   Set new monthly meeting schedule with wider team for progress updates (suggesting 3rd Thursday of the month 9:45-10:30am)

Next Tuesday titer results of current Ambr15 study will inform next steps for cell line and process dev.

        *   Context: CLD starting to work with opto-chassis asap. Determining what molecule they will work with. However, there may be pressure to move to a different mAb that has higher titers.
        *   Things that can use Humira to help us derisk MAM01 will be great.
# Progress Updates
## General Project Updates
*   MAM01 MTA w/ Gates Foundation
    *   AA Sequence received on Thu 6/5
    *   Intro made to MRI contact, waiting for response
*   Still waiting for progress report review (no cost extension yet)
    *   Submitted ~4/1
*   Potential additional Humira work
    *   Discussion with Jacqueline earlier Thursday
*   Project update slides being sent out this Friday
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Foundation finally reviewing progress report as of this morning and has asked for minor additions before signing off on which I'll resubmit asap.
*   Received the MAM01 amino acid sequence from the Foundation which differs in a single amino acid in the light chain from the sequence I inferred from a publication so recloning MAM01 now for integration into the CHOZN opto chassis.
*   Anticipate handoff of the CHOZN opto chassis from the Opto Team on **6/30** then will be begin MAM01 integration with GS selected pools/minipools anticipate screening starting ~ 3rd week of July. [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) would like to discuss if we can use Valita titer for screening minipools.
*   Working to get MTA in place with the GMRI so we can get access to MAM01 and discuss project with them- followed up third time this morning.
## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   In progress: Intensified bioreactor runs with shake flask satellites for minipool evaluation. Design below:

Benchling
## Analytics [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532)
*   [Recent purification and Mass spec](https://prolific-machines.benchling.com/s/etr-xbXrDlx1tofdQQbPugME?m=slm-O1E7T9diqsRVooB5eaOm) work suggest why the change to ExpiCHO resulted in hit to our ability to detect adalimumab, we are primarily producing incomplete molecule. The implication being non-specific tools (eg. BLI, ProA-HPLC, VLT) are not accurately representing our titers.
    *   We're producing a lot of F(ab')2, but not much intact protein. Different ratios of intact:fragment. In many conditions, more fragment than intact. Methods using Fc detection are overestimating on-target titer by a large degree.
    *   TI lines have a much higher ratio of inact:Fab. Best overall performance in shake flasks.
    *   3-8x ratio for TI and CMV lines in Basanta and Shahram's intensified 24DWP studies
    *   **Question:** is this caused by biological or analytical phenomena?
*   Analytical is setting up Akta for ProA purification for Lemon Lime project.
    *   Akta could be used for MAM01 purification

*   OKR completion (?)
    *   other person: meet bus
    *   Octet data for 2g/L was run on singlet, so likely shouldn't evaluate fold change based on this data
    *   TI line from Sasha's experiments was 40-fold higher on-target than F(ab')2
        *   however we don't have TI CMV for a comparison
# Action Items
*   Evaluate intact:Fab ratio for TI CMV Humira cell line (compare against TI UAS and sRI CMV lines to determine if this is from integration method or light) [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532)
*   Re-test TI CMV vs. GAVPO-UAS Humira to confirm titer improvements and (hopefully) hit our OKR! [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   Meeting time: Look at rescheduling for ~9:30 going forward. If no availability, keep at 3pm. [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245)
*   **All:** Add new data to data deck. Criteria: any data that is relevant to leadership or other teams. New slides will be added in reverse chronological order (i.e. newest data first)

# Progress Updates
## General Project Updates
*   
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   MAM01 constructs are complete
*   MAM01 cell line engineering will take place after CLD screens clones of the Opto chassis line for growth so this will delay engineering by one week.
*   Still no progress on MTA for MAM01. Would like to have discussion with [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) exploring possible scenarios for analytics.
    *   Is it possible for AnChem to purify protein and ship to BMGMRI?
        *   Likely, but resource constraints for foreseeable future (no time course purification)
        *   AC talking to CLD about automating purification process
    *   If BMGMRI doesn't come back to us about doing analytics, what can we actually do in house?
        *   We have sequence, but no glycosylation
        *   Could do titer, aggregation, fragmentation if resources allow
        *   Charge variance / glycosylation are relative to reference molecule - ideally need to have their reference molecule
    *   If we had analytical results from them, would that be helpful?
        *   critical ranges for glycans would be helpful to reference
        *   transferring methods between sites, instruments is challenging - could be difficult to hit their results
    *   Could we show comparability in glycan profile between molecule produced by CMV vs GAVPO-UAS?
        *   we could share this data as long as we share details about how the data was collected (e.g. a different method than what they were using internally)
    *   If BMGMRI is doing analytics, Likely best-case scenario for getting data from them is 3 weeks, but will likely be longer
    *   If we have QTPP, we could use that to claim that our molecule is hitting their targets
*   Planned comparisons:
    *   Yes:
        *   Humira - CMV vs GAVPO-UAS (titer and quality)
        *   MAM01 - making product using light, but TBD whether to compare to originator
    *   No:
        *   Humira - our product vs. originator
*   John thawed H1 minipool of site-specific ROSA integration of CMV Humira and sorted cells. They are not mCherry+ which they should be. Considering thawing other minipools to see if there was a labeling error when Oscar froze minipools down.
## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   BP25-eHUM-DB001 bioreactor run is complete ([benchling](https://prolific-machines.benchling.com/prolific-machines/f/lib_t0zcV4BJ-expicho/etr_227xJLIB-ehum-brx-runs-bp25-ehum-db001/edit)). **TLDR** Run results were messy, unable to make confident conclusions about cellular behavior.
*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Surface staining does not have any correlation with titer in production phase so cannot be used for an in-run titer estimate
    *   TI Humira produced significantly more in a shake flask than in the bioreactor. Bioreactor was significantly more stressed as indicated by the lactate levels, plus there were differences in the illumination power between palkias and arbok. Conclusions about addbacks or culture behavior unavailable due to lack of biological replicates.
        *   Shake Flask (BR583) Max Titer: 1.34 g/L
        *   Bioreactor (BR575) Max Titer: 0.34 g/L
    *   CMV Minipool produced more than CMV Pool.
        *   CMV Minipool Max Titer: 1.8 g/L
        *   CMV Pool Max Titer: 0.57 g/L
*   Future Work:
    *   Fresh samples provided higher titer on the Octet compared to frozen samples. How do we want to store & run samples in the future?
        *   When possible given Achem resources, will run fresh samples within 1 week, otherwise freeze.

## General Project Updates
*   MAM01 timeline now in ClickUp [here](https://app.clickup.com/36217409/v/li/901111238843)
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   **Delayed**: Handoff of the CHOZN Elite GAVPO clone from the CLD Team is now **7/23** (original handoff 7/7).
    *   We'll be picking same clones as Opto team
*   Final BLIMP1 constructs are complete.
*   Awaiting execution of MAM01 MTA submitted to the Gates MRI. We have a new contact that's helping move things along. [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) if we received purified MAM01 as reference material would it be reasonable/possible to perform titer and intact mass analysis in house to help quickly optimize our production runs? We could then inquire about Gates Foundation collaborator performing glycan analysis (if too laborious to stand up in house). If we did this how much purified MAM01 would we require from Gates MRI for benchmarking?
    *   Amount of purified material:
        *   how many titer experiments do we want to run [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)?
            *   plan for 2xmonth for 6 months = 12 titer runs + 3 extra spot checks = **15 total**
        *   1mg: 1-2 titer experiments & intact experiments
        *   10mg should be sufficient to start
        *   ideally we can request another lot in 1-2 months
        *   dose is ~150mg, so hopefully we can get close to that much
*   Sharing the [MAM01 reference paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02659-z#Sec11) with the wider team. [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) would suggest reviewing their production conditions.
*   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) what process development can be done with CHOZN Elite WT or CHOZN Elite GAVPO clone in advance of MAM01 lines to derisk? Is Nur working on this now?
    *   Optochassis (GAVPO Clone) will be useful to test GAVPO stability + growth behaviors
        *   **opto and/or CLD can do GAVPO stability work**
    *   Nur will have CMV clones next week and I can do optochassis work in parallel for initial feeding regiment

Note we are still observing a MW shift compared to "controls". The method was developed and evaluated for performance against MSQC16 and shows good performance to published literature, however we are observing lower quality matches and as this data is from crude samples until the released glycan method is deployed and we can confirm these results should be interpreted cautiously (there are overlapping Glycoforms that could explain the delta in most abundant species).

## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   MAM01 cell line development is underway:
MAM01 sequences for variable light and variable heavy chain are the original sequences from [MAM01 development Nature publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02659-z)
Constant light [IGLC7\*01](https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/Proteins/alleles/index.php?species=Homo%20sapiens&group=IGLC&gene=IGLC7) and heavy [IGHG1\*01](https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/Proteins/alleles/index.php?species=Homo%20sapiens&group=IGHC&gene=IGHG1) chain with M428L/N434S mutation in the Fc region to extend antibody half-life were codon optimized by Genscript.
[IGLV2-8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01709/entry#sequences) signal peptide was used for the light chain and [IGKV1‑39](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01597/entry) signal peptide for the heavy chain.
*       *   Two GAVPO Opto clones 65 and 156 were selected to engineer in which displayed different levels of blue-light activation and fold change (data from Opto team screening). Pursuing two clones for derisking.
        *   156: good light activity, more background
        *   65: good fold change, lower light activity
*       *   Transfected clones with CMV MAM01 (HLL) and UAS MAM01 (HLL) then waited 72 hours for recovery before beginning GS selection.
    *   Transfection efficiency was above 95%.
    *   Seeded 1M cells for pool generation (1 pool per construct) and 100 cells for minipool generation (768 minipools per construct). Started minipools with 100 cells to increase recovery of high-producers by limiting cell number.
    *   Day 10 of GS selection: pools are starting to show signs of recovery. Anticipate minipools will recover ~ 1 week after the pools.
    *   Once recovered (greater that 90% viability) minipools will be screened by Valita titer after 5-7 days illumination in static incubator. Coordinating Arbok use with BPD for screen. Total of 32 x 96 well plates for screen.
    *   Will downselect from 768 minipools to top 24 minipools for each construct/clone.
    *   Top 24 minipools will then undergo 5-7 day production run in 24 DWP to identify top 1-2 minipools.
    *   Depending on titer achieved by top minipools can either go clonal on the Beacon or supertransfect top minipools to further boost titer if necessary.
*   Engineering MAM01 constructs to test if sequence can be further optimize to increase MAM01 expression by either gene configuration or additional codon optimization (current constructs are HLL will test LHL, LLH and additional Genscript codon optimization of variable light and heavy chains)
Experiment: Transient transfection in CHOZN Elite then assess secreted Ab production 5-7 days later
*   CMV and UAS PYC2 sleeping beauty constructs are ready.
*   Jacqueline Kirchner, Deputy Director of Biologics Discovery for Global Health at the Gates Foundation will be visiting on Monday. Any cool workflows we can show her while she's on-site?
*   Would like to discuss how to better employ Ambr15 for project.
    *   Can we get other people trained on the instrument?
    *   Ideally demonstrate synergies with other initiatives
    *   useful for scaling: we can't titrate light well
    *   ~$20k to integrate Ambr with Nova Flex2
*   Unfortunately no progress on MTA with the Gates MRI.
## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   BRX Run (DB003) unfortunately showed significantly lower titer in the UAS lines than the CMV. Root cause analysis is still being investigated but internal GAVPO staining showed lower signal than prior runs, which could indicate a loss of GAVPO expression over seed train.

*   Shake flask run with TI CMV and TI UAS lines was started early with a 4 day growth + 8 day production. D11 titer is being analyzed today
    *   Arbok had a brown out so we lost 2.5d of illumination :( Issue has been fixed and internal staining indicates UAS activation

    *   Nessa connecting with that team next week
# Progress Updates
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Due to temperature incident with the GLP incubator last Thursday that resulted in significant cell death **MAM01 cell line development is delayed**:
    *   We are working to recover from this setback as quickly as we can. We thawed low passage numbers of the two Opto hosts (clone 65 and 156) and transfected CMV MAM01 and UAS MAM01 on earlier this week. GS selection of pools and minipools is being set up today. Huge THANK YOU to John for being proactive and resilient in the face of this setback.
    *   We noticed in our previous work that the MAM01 minipools recovered at different rates so minipool screening will likely happen in a staggered fashion.
    *   We anticipate being able to downselect minipools clone 65 UAS MAM01 first. We'll downselect from 768 (8 x 96 well plates) to 24 minipools by mid September. We'll then run a 7-day 24DWP study with the 24 top minipools to select our top 1-3 minipools the last week of September. **How does this impact BPD timelines?**
        *   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) Intention is to do foundational development with the current opto-clones with Nur in the meantime. Hopefully this will provide initial conditions, allowing the first BRX runs with the MAM01 clones in the second week of October
    *   The MTA with the Gates MRI has been finalized and just needs to be signed. They have agreed to provide 200 mg of MAM01 and share their analytical data - TBD what that exactly means.

## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   Welcome Brandon!
*   [Results from DB003](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YxFbJ5IpBrE3YmanuC3w_BKMch51mO5WwsKHdl60mQw/edit?slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316#slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316) - Slide deck in progress
    *   **TLDR: CMV outperformed UAS, likely** **due to GAVPO loss in cell line.**
    *   The 250mL dasbox run with our CMV Minipool #3 and UAS Minipool #10 successfully ran for 13 days (4 days growth/9 days production). This was the first time we ran the single use bioreactors for a mAb producing line as the dark controls.
        *   Lost the CMV dark replicate #1 (in a glass vessel) on day 8 due to a pH probe failure. The pH probe was removed from service.
        *   SU vessels appear to be comparable to the glass vessels with some additional improvements. The offgas filter fouled the first day of culture causing significant backpressure, increased pCO2, and increased foaming in the SU vessels, so future runs will utilize offgas condenser earlier in the run. All future BPD runs will utilize the SU vessels.
        *   CMV significantly outperformed the UAS lines over the culture, and we observed higher titers in the CMV dark conditions compared to the light conditions
            *   CMV, Dark: 1.4 g/L
            *   CMV, Light: 1.0 g/L
            *   UAS, Light: 0.3 g/L
            *   Internal GAVPO staining showed significant drop in GAVPO staining between DB001 and DB003 runs, likely leading to lack of sufficient GAVPO to activate.
            *   Basanta ran a 6 production with the CMV Minipool 3 a week after the end of DB003 and only had 30 mg/L of titer at the end, showing drift in that line as well. When he placed it back in puromycin, the cells died demonstrating that the resistant genes as part of the mAb cassette was likely lost. Stability of both lines is therefore in question --> moving forward, all seed trains need to be under constant selection to prevent cellular drift prior to production runs (shouldn't be an issue with CHOZNe)
                *   [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) this is not entirely accurate. We believe there's been potential genetic drift with the cells Basanta used for his experiment but this hasn't been confirmed. He was also concerned whether the genotype of the cells was correct. To try and get some understanding he applied puromycin to the cells and saw the viability decreased confirming the population was at least not completely puromycin resistant. If the cells had been maintained in culture for a long duration of time it is feasible there has been drift in this minipool. Faster growing cells producing less antibody could take over the culture, cells could also be silencing the selection marker while maintaining it in their genome.
                *   Confirmation will be done by copy analysis via ddPCR of old and new cell banks for both HC/LC and GAVPO
            *   Observed color difference in media between illuminated and dark vessels (illuminated media was turning from yellow to brown-ish). Nur has also observed a similar trend in the CHOZNe runs. Future de-risking will be sending dark vs. light samples out for metabolomics screen to understand root cause and risk to future production cultures.
*   **Results from SF008 -** data still incoming
    *   UAS Titer >>>> CMV Titer
        *   Day 11: UAS 832mg/L, CMV below LOQ
        *   Ran for 15 days - rest of titer results to be processed on BLI later
*   p65 and p156 Seed Train GAVPO De-risking
    *   Fixing and Freezing a cell bank of both optoclones at every passage to perform GAVPO staining and ddPCR over cell age to test drift prior to MAM01 development.
    *   [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) James mentioned the clones are behaving considerably differently in regards to DT and metabolite profiles can you speak a little more on this?
        *   p65 is doubling very slowly compared to p156
*   Sasha and Nur doing foundational development for BPD to derisk in advance
    *   Nur getting clones from Opto next week for this work
    *   Meeting next week to determine what work will be done with these cell lines
*   Biggest risk from BPD perspective is stability of cell lines
    *   **Question:** is optoTA stability in scope for CLD team?
*   Ambr15:
    *   Training required for add'l team members, but costs $$$ and time (may need to send team members to NY for training)
    *   From Alex T: No Ambr15 usage for foreseeable future
*   Other projects going into bioreactors:
    *   We currently don't have data demonstrating scalability from 24DWP to 250mL and larger.

## Analytics:
*   No known analytics required for anything beyond tubespin scale (as of today)
*   Most research focus on smaller scale proof of concept data for customer engagements
    *   Lonza has no intention of going to BPD for POC1
*   Offer out to candidate for Scientist position!

# Progress Updates
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Gates Foundation returned comments on grant cost-extension request which needs to be resubmitted by Friday. Outstanding issue: They requested functional studies be performed on light and conventionally produced MAM01. Functional studies can be performed through a GHDC collaboration but require purified MAM01. Can analytics support purification?
*   GAVPO host cell lines (clone 65 and 156) transfected with CMV MAM01 and UAS MAM01 have been in GS selection ~two weeks now. Pools (seeded 1M cells) and minipools (seeded 100 cells) are recovering as expected. Clone 65 UAS MAM01 minipools are recovering the fastest again.
*   Testing 3-day deoxys/Valita titer screening strategy with original clone 65 UAS MAM01 minipools to establish assay in advance of new minipools being ready.

## **MAM01 data discussion**
For contexts the original grant specifications with regard to analytic data of Humira were:
Two-liter bioreactors will be employed for fed-batch processing. **Antibody titer** will be monitored daily using an **Octet system equipped with Protein A biosensor**. 
For downstream processing, conditioned culture media will be harvested on **day 12 of production** (or when cell viability is ~75%) and filtered prior to **Protein A antibody capture**. Protein A bound adalimumab will be acid eluted, neutralized, buffer exchanged then **polished by a single cation exchange** step. Antibody quality will be assessed by the following: **aggregate and fragmentation analysis** by size exclusion–high-performance liquid chromatography, **charge variant analysis** by cation exchange–high-performance liquid chromatography, **N-glycan analysis** by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of the intact antibody or HILIC-fluorescence and TNFα **antigen binding analysis** by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

**Grant cost extension specifics with regard to MAM01 analytics:**
MAM01 yield and quality attributes will be assessed to determine whether light-inducible production can enhance productivity and quality (Aim 1). These studies will be performed at different scales including deep well plates, shake flasks and 250 ml bioreactors.
Funded output of grant:
1. Analytical assessment of **quality attributes of MAM01 produced under optogenetic control versus conventional production**.
Measurement and evaluation:
The project outcome will be evaluated by the following questions: 
1. Can optogenetic antibody production enhance antibody productivity versus traditional production methods?
To address this **MAM01 titer** from light-controlled versus traditional production will be monitored during production. **Cell-specific productivity** will also be determined.
 2. Can optogenetic antibody production enhance product quality?
To address this MAM01 quality attributes from light-controlled versus traditional production will be determined. (**intact mass**, and **glycan profile and functional activity in collaboration with the GHDC at Duke University**) from light-controlled versus traditional production will be determined.

Methods from MAM01 reference paper:
10-day 24-deep-well plate fed-batch production assay with cell pool. Cell pool producing ~20 pg/cell/day. Day 10 titer ~2.4 g/L. Pool was seeded in quadruplicate at 1 × 106 cells ml−1 in 3 ml 80% proprietary BAK004-026 and 20% CD OptiCHO. Days 3, 6 and 8, cells were fed 5% with CellBoost 7 A and 0.5% of CellBoost 7B. Day 10 the spent media from replicates were pooled, purified by ProteinA resin and buffer exchanged into PBS at 1 mg/ml for further analysis.
# Progress Updates
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Parallel MAM01 cell line engineering was performed in two GAVPO host cell lines (clone 65 and 156) to derisk host cell line while CLD team is performing 30/60/90 day growth studies. We've decided to down select to GAVPO clone 156 only due to suboptimal growth and other poor characteristics we've observed.
*   Pools and minipools of GAVPO clone 156 UAS MAM01 have recovered from GS selection and are currently being screened.
Initial illumination study with pools of UAS MAM01 (156 2122) and CMV MAM01 (156 2117) produced unexpected result. Seeded 1M cells in 500 μl and ran deoxys with 1μW/mm2 constant light ~65 hrs. BLI data of pools in triplicate indicates UAS MAM01 (156 2122) is barely producing antibody. CMV MAM01 pool (156 2117) looks good!
![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/ce398347-5022-41cd-8822-2fc7cdad7de2/MAM01%20Pool%20BLI%20Data.001.jpeg)

Some potential causes for lack of production in UAS MAM01 (156 2122):
1.     1.     1. Line maybe less/more sensitive to light intensity than other lines we've worked with?
        2. Malfunction of deoxys during run?
        3. Issue with transfected plasmid? Plasmids sent for sequencing verification again and are correct.
        4. Accidental switch of pools during study?
        5. Issue with host cell line?
Repeating illumination study again with pools of UAS MAM01 (156 2122) and CMV MAM01 (156 2117) with a range of illumination intensities (0.25 - 5 μW/mm2 constant and pulsing). Will have results at the end of week.
*       *   CMV MAM01 (clone 156 P2117) pool could potentially be used to start development of MAM01 analytics- would like to discuss this with the team to understand if this would be useful.
        *   Awaiting 24DWP support from CLD
        *   Potentially ready for handoff - at shake flask scale
*       *   Minipools of CMV MAM01 (clone 156 P2117) are currently not recovering very well so may need to perform clonal isolation on Beacon from pool. Recovery of clones/expansion would take ~1 month

    *   Pools not significantly useful for longer dasbox runs due to population drift
    *   Planning on using CMV Pool for general process tests in TPPs (handoff timeframe)?
    *   What material does analytics need?

## Analytics:
*   Questions - MAM01 CLD funnel
    *   With a more explicit outcome of functional testing at the end of the project it would be helpful to know more about the plan for development of the cell line, and timelines
Nessa: confirm timeline as action item
*       *   How much in CLD characterization do we want to do and the implication of when would we like those tools in-place? Nessa: confirm in action item
    *   Beyond the listed characterization (Glycoforms, deglycosylated intact mass) are there additional data points desired in the funnel (eg. SEC, Charge variants). Nessa: confirm in action item
    *   Confirming GF would execute final functionality testing via Duke? Nessa: Yes
    *   When should we expect data packet and material from GF? Nessa: followed up again with Gates MRI. Hopeful asap.

# Progress Updates
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) [@John Resngit](#user_mention#87300823)
*   Gates MRI shipped purified MAM01 which is arriving 10/1 before 10:30 am. Fedex tracking [884798185406](https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?trknbr=884798185406&trkqual=2460949000~884798185406~FX&simplified=true) Supplied 2 vials, containing 0.1mL MAM01 at 155.8 mg/mL. Stored at -80°C.
*   CMV MAM01 pool (GAVPO clone 156 P2117) pool was handed off to BPD for process development and early analytical analysis. Results from last weeks production study? Intact mass? [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532)
*   CMV MAM01 pool (GAVPO clone 156 P2117) was loaded yesterday on Beacon to generated clones. Will export top 192 clones.
    *   Will see on Friday how they're doing
*   Illumination study with UAS MAM01 pool (GAVPO clone 156 P2122) with range of illumination intensities (0.25 - 5 μW/mm2 constant and pulsing) confirmed light-inducible pool was weakly responsive to light.
Ruled out some potential causes for lack of production:
1.     1.     1. ~~Line maybe less/more sensitive to light intensity than other lines we've worked with?~~
        2. ~~Malfunction of deoxys during run?~~
        3. ~~Issue with transfected plasmid?~~ Plasmid sent for sequencing verification again and was correct by sequencing. Performed diagnostic digest of vector with multiple restriction enzymes to visualize P2122. Two digests suggested plasmid correct, one digest suggested there may be an issue with the vector. As digest results were ambiguous, remade P2122 vector which has been sequence verified and confirmed by digestion.

1.     1.     1. ~~Accidental switch of pools during study?~~
        2. Issue with host cell line? Transfected host cell line with UAS mScarlet reporter construct to verify host. Assessing mScarlet expression after 24 hr illumination tomorrow.

*   Transfected new P2122 UAS MAM01 construct into GAVPO clone 156 to generate pool, minipools and clone. Starting GS selection on tomorrow. Will update timeline asap.
    *   Transfected yesterday, will see results in a couple weeks

## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   Reminder: Sasha OOO 10/3 -> 10/19
*   Ran [4 day growth study of the MAM01 CMV Pool](https://prolific-machines.benchling.com/prolific-machines/f/lib_3U8QrGdLIz-mam01-chozne/etr_YCE5YKMgcs-mam01-cmv-pool-check/edit) in shake flask and observed similar titer compared to 96 well plate (~300 mg/L). Material was handed off to Ian for intact analysis.
*   Completed the [250mL dasbox run](https://prolific-machines.benchling.com/prolific-machines/f/lib_HK6hKdYvMe-chozne-foundational-development/etr_nS3IaMPJZ5-chozne-humira-dasbox-run-zhum-db001/edit) with the UAS Humira (H+L) and CMV Humira (HLL) clones. Maximum titer achieved was 5g/L on day 14. Analysis ongoing.
*   Completed the [2L illuminated perfusion run](https://prolific-machines.benchling.com/prolific-machines/f/lib_HK6hKdYvMe-chozne-foundational-development/etr_ZoYYgCGBFd-illuminated-perfusion-test-run/edit) with the UAS Humira (H+L) clone. We were able to successfully split growth and production during the run, going from growth > production > growth > production throughout the 10 day run. Maximum VCD was 68M cells at 91% viability.
    *   Titer analysis by Brenna on HPLC next week
    *   Successfully gathered 10 days of RAMAN spectra as well for future analysis
    *   Run ended on D11 due to operational issue. Discussion of follow-up N-1 perfusion run in early October ongoing.

## Analytics:
*   Reminder: Ian OOO 10/8→10/22
*   Completed initial MAM01 glycoform and deglycosylated characterization from CMV lines. Attempted subunit however recovery was too low not allowing for compare to Just's data packet
*   A Method brief for charge variant analysis is currently in production and will be released within the week. This will include MAM01.
    *   The purpose of this document is to provide high-level information on the planned development of a new analytical method. It also outlines expected method performance characteristics and key strategic considerations.
    *   The document also serves as an opportunity for stakeholders to review the approach and provide feedback prior to the initiation of method development.
        *   **To be shared with Nessa and CLD leads for feedback**

# Agenda:
*   Octet Humira surrogate issue - what does this mean octet can be used for and what impact does it have on analytical team HPLC asks?
    *   Biosensor lot-lot variability leads to variable differences between surrogate and MAM01 (we have seen differences as large as 70% but likely larger - we've only tested two lots)
    *   **Recommendations for using BLI for MAM01:**
        *   Ranking only (qualitative)
        *   No reporting of quantitative values of MAM01 from BLI data (including normalized differences)
        *   ALWAYS run a standard curve in duplicate (this is guidance in SOP)
        *   Reporting information from assay:
            *   Instrument defaults to units of absolute measurement, but these should not be used
            *   [@Brenna Pleitner](#user_mention#90251616) will update SOP to provide additional guidance here
    *   **Recommendations for cell line** /**clone selection:**
        *   Run samples from top-performing cell lines on ProA HPLC in order to get more quantitative metrics on how well cell lines are performing
        *   _Coordinate with AnChem well ahead of time to determine when these samples would need to be run_
        *   However, over-dilution prior to running samples on Octet (e.g. if expecting high titers) may lead to less accurate rank ordering - puts concentrations into lower performant range
            *   [@Brenna Pleitner](#user_mention#90251616) to provide a recommendation on working ranges of BLI response that are acceptable for rank ordering
    *   For quantitative data on MAM01 concentration, recommendation is to use ProA HPLC
        *   Impact is TBD - many projects are transitioning to using HPLC for quant
    *   Next steps for BPD samples:
        *   Final data points will be run on ProA HPLC
    *   Valita titer assay:
        *   similar challenge exists for differences between lots and plates
        *   there are some potential pros, but also some challenges with implementation of the assay
            *   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) and [@John Resngit](#user_mention#87300823) to discuss these issues and review data from yesterday
    *   [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) and [@Brenna Pleitner](#user_mention#90251616) to do freeze-thaw comparison for MAM01 samples using SEC
*   Data deck and #internal data channel [sharing guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nriMmwtnn4MIcPt8F9LLu3PZEibJL38LZnaSfacLpKA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gtaqlaorqg6f)

# Progress Updates
### CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   New UAS MAM01 (P\_2122) and CMV MAM01 (P\_2117) pools were run in duplicate in 24-well static production with illumination. This is newly constructed P\_2122-A plasmid. Result: UAS MAM01 (P\_2122-A) is weakly responsive to light. 10X production in light vs dark but significantly weaker than CMV.

    *   Best practice for BLI titer between biosensors/experiments?
        *   Able to compare results (rank order) easily within a set of biosensors, but as I run comparisons between experiments and lots, what is the most accurate way to compare?
    *   External media testing
        *   Do we have the $ to submit for external media testing to fast track some feed tuning? Understanding which media components are being consumed the fastest can help me time feeding during production runs without significant experimental throughput.
            *   Assuming $100/sample, and submit 20 samples --> $2k
    *   Data compiling for previous iterations --> ExpiCHO? CHOZNe Humira?
        *   Tidy up the benchlings, de- priority of deck/analysis
        *   Producing MAM01 is the most important

**Analytical Method Development Update – MAM01**
**Intact Mass Spec**
*   Material received from Sasha (CMV Pool) was purified via ProA spin columns, buffer exchanged into 10mM ammonium formate and run with prior mAb intact mass method
*   Our CMV expressed molecule shows higher proteoform heterogeneity than supplied standard and different glycan distribution
*   Upon deglycosylation recovered molecule and reference standard matched within 1.6 Da supporting we are expressing correct species
**Size Distribution Profile**
*   The in-house platform mAb method provides a comparable size distribution profile and is ready for use.
*   We’re observing slightly higher aggregation than previously reported, likely due to shipping conditions and additional freeze/thaw cycles.
HMW: 5% higher than reported; Monomer: 5% lower than reported; but chromatographic resolution is similar to reported indicating analytical methods are fit for purpose.
**Released Glycan Profile**
*   The in-house platform mAb method provides a similar glycan profile to the reported data.
*   However, I was not fully satisfied with the chromatographic resolution of one isobaric glycan pairs. Follow-up experiments have been completed to improve separation, and processing method updates are in progress to enable faster data turnaround post-analysis and reporting.
*   This method is expected to be ready for use by the end of the week.
_Note:_ A purification step is required prior to released glycan analysis and charge variant analysis. Evelyn is leading this effort, working with Sasha, who will be the first to request the released glycan workflow and has generously offered to provide test material — thank you, Sasha!
**Charge Variant Analysis**
*   Two gradient methods have been evaluated. While chromatographic resolution for basic isoforms is improved from reported, resolution for acidic isoforms remains limited, a clear plan is in place to optimize further.
*   The finalized method is targeted for completion by mid-November.
\[Acidic and Basic each increase 2% from reported, while main peak is reduced 4% from reported\]
**Titer Analysis**
*   The initial plan utilized BLI Protein A titer analysis with a surrogate mAb and response correction.
    *   Early testing showed that response differences between MAM01 and surrogate mAbs vary by biosensor lot, making BLI unreliable for accurate quantitation unless a lot-specific correction curve is established.
    *   BLI Protein A may still be useful for relative comparisons or clone ranking, but not for absolute quantitation.
*   ProA HPLC-UV titer analysis (not originally scoped) will begin next week as the new priority. The plan remains to use a surrogate mAb with response correction to minimize dependency on limited MAM01 reference material.

# 2025-11-12 BMGF Team Meeting

# Attendees:

# Agenda:
*   Discuss timing of producing >200mg of MAM01 for use as QC for Octet results
    *   200mg would be enough for 250 Octet experiments (> 250 plates)
    *   Getting material from Gates would save AnChem ~2wks of 2 FTEs for purification work
    *   Doing purification in-house would be a valuable exercise for AnChem, but would have to deprioritize other work
    *   Harvested CCF is available from recent BPD runs, so no additional runs would be required to produce the material
    *   [@Ian Ronningen](#user_mention#72121532) to check current inventory of MAM01 reference material
    *   We could probably conservatively use reference material from Gates Foundation as a QC for BLI measurements
    *   Basanta to use Humira as surrogate for BLI measurements today
    *   [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) **to connect with Gates Foundation about getting more reference material - 200mg - need to make a decision by end of next week on whether AnChem will do purification.**

## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Ongoing troubleshooting to identify root cause of weak UAS MAM01 expression:
    *   Goal: Ensure P\_2122A\_UAS\_MAM01\_Hc\_BGHpolyA\_UAS\_MAM01\_Lc\_BGHpolyA\_UAS\_MAM01\_Lc\_BGHpolyA\_SV40p\_Glutamine\_Synthetase\_BGHpolyA DNA sequence is correct.

    *   Goal: Ensure host cell line, GAVPO clone 156, is functioning properly. Experiment: Transient transfection of UAS-Herceptin-IRES-mScarlet to confirm GAVPO activation leads to light-inducible protein expression. 7-day production run performed after transient transfection. Result: **Basanta saw light titratable mScarlet expression suggesting GAVPO clone 156 is able to induce expression of target proteins in a light-titratable manner.**
*   ![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/9ebcbe26-9028-49f2-92ee-0e44cb9b011f/image.png)
    *   Goal: Ensure UAS vector backbone integrates properly into host genome and can GAVPO clone 156 host can produce light-induciable antibody. Experiment: Generate UAS and CMV Humira stable pools in GAVPO clone 156 by GS selection and perform 24 hour static light-induction in 24 WP. Result: John saw similar to UAS MAM01 that UAS Humira is only weakly expressed in the light vs dark while CMV Humira produced as expected. **This suggests the GAVPO host clone 156 is not a viable host for antibody production.** P2107 is UAS Humira, P2106 is CMV Humira positive control. Clone 156 is negative control.

*   Goal: Ensure expression cassette is transcriptionally active. Experiment: Transient transfection of UAS MAM01, UAS + CMV intron MAM01 and UAS + EF1a intron MAM01 in GAVPO clone 156 to confirm plasmids can produce light-inducible MAM01. Result: [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) update?
*   **The two GAVPO clones (clone 65 and 156) engineered by the Opto team we have tested do not appear to be viable host cell lines for antibody production**. We are now taking different strategies to engineer the light-inducible MAM01 cell line:
    *   Use GAVPO pool (CHOZN Elite GS KO 021 004 P\_1281 bulk, H (1281 Bulk High) Opto Team engineered as initial cell line for engineering. This strategy will require GS selection in pools then clone selection on the Beacon. This strategy can not produce minipools for early process development due to the fact that GAVPO copy number is heterogenous. This will require screening the clones for light-inducible expression and determining the GAVPO copy number in the best performers. Timeline is being updated now. Initial dates: pools available for testing 11/26, pool data 12/1. Pools can potentially loaded on Beacon for clonal selection immediately after (need to confirm date with CLD) - Outgrowth over the holiday break.

    *   Engineer Cry2oligo 8xTet MAM01 cell line. Rationale: Opto team has not engineered any additional GAVPO hosts and has prioritized other blue light systems for development. They have Cry2oligo expressing cells which could be used as potential host cell line. This removes FTO concerns with GAVPO. Need to confirm with Max to understand what clone(s) have been used for successful engineering.

    *   Outcome:
        *   Growth behavior and viability are slightly different in response to media blends across the two cell lines but 75% ActiPro supports high growth and viability for UAS Humira and 0-75% ActiPro had similar growth for CMV MAM01. **Qp and titer were best for both lines around a 50/50 blend.**
        *   ActiPro has potential to be a more effective basal media but could require some media adaption. Future work will be using N-1 in production media blend and tuning blend percentage. Media choice on PQ also needs to be performed prior to media lock.

# Progress Updates
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
After considerable root cause analysis we believe we have identified that the weak inducibility of the light-inducible MAM01 cell lines engineered were a result of the GAVPO host line being nonfunctional. We are working with CLD to confirm the host line has lost GAVPO expression.

*   John is now engineering UAS and CMV MAMM01 lines in a CHOZN Elite GAVPO pool (021 004 P\_1281 bulk, H) with the following constructs:

Pools are currently in GS selection and will be screened for production in a static 5-day production. We should have their performance data 12/2. Top performing pools will be loaded onto the Beaon 12/4 for single cell clonal selection.
*   In parallel Basanta is performing a transient transfection of the CHOZN Elite GAVPO pool (021 004 P\_1281 bulk, H) that was provided by the Opto team with the same plasmids to get an early read on the GAVPO activity of the pool. We are cautiously optimistic of the preliminary transient transfection data. The stable cell line work John is doing will be the real test of this pool as transient transfection can be a noisy readout.

## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   MAM01 Minipool Results from Dasbox show exceptional productivity but poor growth and viability.
    *   MP1 = 2F3 pH 7.15 Temp 34C
    *   MP2 = 4D8 pH 7.15 Temp 34C

*   N-1 perfusion unlocked high inoc density and improved feeding regime (5% 7A every other day) lead to highest titers in Prolific (10.6 g/L and 8.1g/L)
    *   Lower Qp in intensified process: likely due to Viability/productivity drop from d10-d14 (stopped feeding every other day due to glutamate inhibition → when cells don't get 7A feed, viability and productivity drop)
    *   Green shading: intensified illumination start and temp shift

*   Next Up: Tuning high titer process development in December with clone 2-3. Readout of PQ results for MAM01 and UAS Humira conditions to understand process implications on product quality
## Analytics:
*   Flag: We currently have more characterization requests than we have people or instrument time for, which will result in extended TATs. We'll be running experiments aligned with company priorities.
    *   booking through mid-Jan for experiments that have been submitted to-date.
    *   Even with another HPLC, people time would be bandwidth-constraining
*   CEX Method development for CVA of MAM01 are illustrating different abundance of acidic, main, and basic compared to cIEF method used in MAM01 COA. Compared to cIEF current CEX method observes less acidic species and more basic species.
    *   Method development evaluated both pH and salt elution with a focus on strong cation exchange stationary phase
    *   [@Brenna Pleitner](#user_mention#90251616) to send more quantitative information to Nessa on differences
    *   closing the gap will likely be non-trivial because methods are quite different.
        *   this is only from the reference material - methodology only, not from our process
    *   [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) to follow up with Jacqueline re: Gates Foundation's position on these differences.
        *   good separation, but not identical. useful read on quality but not a direct, comparable method to what Just-Evotec ran.
*   We have completed another run for surrogate quantification of MAM01 via ProA-HPLC, run completed 11/21 and will be summarized week of 12/1
*   Still no response from Gates foundation re: getting more MAM01 reference material :(
*   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) and [@Brenna Pleitner](#user_mention#90251616) to follow up on BLI data using surrogate method

## Action items:
*   [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) [@John Resngit](#user_mention#87300823) make sure to submit requests for analytical chemistry ASAP
    *   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) to follow up.
*   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) / [@Brandon Nguyen](#user_mention#54153253) - quick spot check on Nova images of cells in late stages of run – are we still accurately counting VCD/viability as cells get larger?

# 2025-12-10 BMGF Team Meeting

# Attendees:

# Agenda:
*   Discuss transition from BLI to Cedex
    *   Cedex installation (+validation by Roche) happening ~end of Jan
    *   Next step: discussion of how do validation, reporting
    *   Sasha will be BPD super-user, Bio super-user needs to be identified
    *   Proposal from Sasha: Octet used for rank order comparison, Cedex used for quant titer measurements for downselection → HPLC ProA w/ Analytics
        *   Cedex has internal calibration so data should be more trustworthy. Also much higher throughput, cheaper
*   Holiday ordering deadline is this Friday 12/12
*   MAM01 method development
*   Check-in: work over break - does everyone have the support they need?
    *   BPD - no seed trains over the break. [@Brandon Nguyen](#user_mention#54153253) will thaw the vials of top CMV MAM01 clones on Jan 2.
    *   Basanta - on-site for Raspberry and CLD, as well as MAM01 double-selection clones
    *   John - feeding clones coming off Beacon this week
# Follow-up from last meeting:
*   [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) [@John Resngit](#user_mention#87300823) make sure to submit requests for analytical chemistry ASAP
    *   One was submitted for John for CMV MAM01 clones - first need to review data [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) [@John Resngit](#user_mention#87300823) [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730)
        *   new entries will have to wait until new year - samples start running on Jan 5th
        *   [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) add anticipated date in January for next samples
            *   re-prioritization discussions will be happening in new year for AnChem
*   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) / [@Brandon Nguyen](#user_mention#54153253) - quick spot check on Nova images of cells in late stages of run – are we still accurately counting VCD/viability as cells get larger?
    *   Yes - Recommend using 1:6 dilution for VCD >10e6c/mL. Cell diameter becomes less confident as viability declines due to irregularity of shape but okay for trending across the run

## General Project Updates

# Progress Updates
## CLD [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556)
*   Engineered UAS and CMV MAMM01 pools in the CHOZN Elite GAVPO pool (021 004 P\_1281 bulk, H) and screened the pools for expression. CMV pools expressed at higher level than all light-inducible versions. Because the GAVPO pool was made without a selection marker the percentage of actual GAVPO positive cells in the pool is unknown and could be changing over time. If there is a low percentage of cells overall that have retained GAVPO expression then this might account for the weaker expression in the light-inducible pools. We are investigating this further. It's also possible that constitutive production of MAM01 doesn't have a negative impact on cell health so recovery of high-producers is possible whereas constitutive expression of Humira may negatively impact cell health/growth impairing recovery of high-producers. If true this would suggest that the CMV promoter outperforms optogenetic promoters when the product has no detrimental impact on the host cell. Looking onto this idea further, have asked Max to provide copy number data for the CMV Humira clones the Opto team generated when they generated the UAS Humira 2-3 clone to understand if the antibody copy number integration was similar between optogenetic clones and CMV clones. Opto team's CMV Humira clones only producing ~3 g/L.
![](https://t36217409.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36217409/943d4611-518f-4c03-9995-b177a0ef0277/MAM01%20pools.jpg)
*   We're conducting an experiment with CLD this week with all the pools and parental pool to understand the percentage of cells in the CHOZN Elite GAVPO pool (021 004 P\_1281 bulk, H) that are GAVPO positive as well as the total percentage of cells that are expressing antibody. Will have data at the end of this week.
*   All pools above were loaded on the Beacon to isolate clones. 1760 pins were loaded and 192 clones were exported which includes for the following:
P\_2122-A (5x UAS MAM01) **24**
P\_2705 (8x UAS + CMV intron MAM01) **40**
P\_2706 (8x UAS + EF1a intron MAM01) **48**
P\_2117 (CMV MAM01) **24**
P\_2701 (CMV + CMV intron MAM01) **24**
P\_2702 (CMV + Ef1a intron MAM01) **32**
*   We're conducing a transient transfection and 24 DWP production run for 48 hours to test GAVPO pool (021 004 P\_1281 bulk, H) and compare vector expression. Will have results at the end of this week.
Makoto's P\_2237 (8x UAS + CAG intron Humira HLL)
Makoto's P\_2239 (8x UAS + CAG intron Humira LLH)
Makoto's P\_2229 (CMV + CAG intron Humira HLL)
Makoto's P\_2231 (CMV + CAG intron Humira LLH)
\*Makoto’s vectors include WPRE \*
Our P\_2106 (CMV Humira HLL)
Our P\_2107 (5x UAS Humira HLL)
Our P\_2702 (CMV + EF1a intron MAM01 HLL)
Our P\_2706 (8x UAS + EF1a intron MAM01 HLL)
[@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) in 1:1 with Max yesterday, we agreed we should move forward with MAM01 cloning in Makoto’s vector, **regardless of the outcome of the transient expression study this week**. Could you help coordinate and see who on the Opto team could assist with this? It would be good to get the design strategy underway asap.
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) could you please follow up with Amritha to see when she anticipates having pools complete from the GAVPO and Cry2oligo transfections she performed.
*   P\_2720\_cHS4\_EF1a\_GAVPO\_BGHpolyA\_mPGK\_Blasticidin\_SV40\_late\_polyA\_cHS4 cloning is underway to engineer stable GAVPO host with drug selection.
## BPD [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)
*   BPD will receive 6-12 of the top CMV MAM01 clones after the break (thaw on Jan 2). Based on analytical data (SEC + ProA HPLC) we will thaw 6+ of the downselected clones to perform a TPP production run to downselect to 2-4 for a BRX run. The top 2-4 will be run in dasbox for final selection.
    *   Selection criteria: Growth rate, production rate, metabolic profile during run, viability decline rate, %monomer
    *   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) **to use Octet data to select clones (SEC data won't be ready on Jan 2)**
*   [**Ongoing High Titer Run with UAS Humira Clone 2-3**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12I20JUsHrzV8pN-FUbqxx8pN30yJSlRhqsdZXMBO5Ag/edit?slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316#slide=id.g2e61e735678_1_316)
    *   Question for [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) - was the non GLP GAVPO pool that 2-3 was derived from frozen down or not prior to transfection?
        *   [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) to follow up with [@Maximilian Hoerner](#user_mention#60202561) about this
        *   [@Ianessa Morantte](#user_mention#54171556) Waiting for copy number info from Opto on CMV and UAS clones
    *   Study Design
        *   Aims: Improve late stage (D8+) viability and test ways to improve Qp
        *   Advantageous Tests:
            *   Production only due to intensification unlock at target and super high densities
                *   _What is possible for titers with full growth/production separation?_
            *   Spinda v Sparbok head to head
                *   _Validate the Spinda alpha effects on cell culture when compared to Sparbok_
            *   Illumination at VCD >60Mc/mL
                *   _Gather in-run data for extremely high VCD illumination effect to add to models + demonstrate capabilities to investors_
        *   **N-1 Perfusion** by [@James Lawrence](#user_mention#75442455)

*       *       *       *   Added 6mM Glutamine to CD Fusion for growth cycle. Achieved 108Mc/mL at 98% viability on D6!
            *   Last day perfused into 50/50 Fed-Batch/ActiPro blend (production media) to prime for inoculation into the dasboxes. Did not appear to hinder growth
            *   d0-d5: growth media, d5-d6: production media, inoculated on d6 from N-1
            *   [@Basanta Dahal](#user_mention#54143730) reservation on high-glutamine N-1 process
                *   cell line may be heterogenous - adding glutamine may enrich for cells with lower copy numbers of GS cassette → non-producing cell lines might be enriched in the N stage
*       *   10x Dasbox
        *   Inoculated from N-1 Perfusion vessel. Fed-batch control inoculated at 5Mc/mL, intensified at 15Mc/mL (1:7 split), and production only at 30Mc/mL (1:3 split).
        *   Intensified temp shifted/illumination started on D1 (yesterday 12/9), fed-batch temp shift/illumination on D2 (today 12/10)
        *   Growth higher than expected.
            *   Production only at 47Mc/mL on D1, adjusted palkia output from 1.5uW --> 2.7 uW

        *   Removed 400mL N-1 for seeding dasbox, added 400 mL production media, temp shifted and started illumination
        *   Production started at 60Mc/mL. D1 was at 70Mc/mL.

## Analytics [@Brenna Pleitner](#user_mention#90251616) :
*   **General AnChem Methods Update**
    *   Titer method
        *   ProA HPLC-UV with MAM01 standard to build calibration curves for quantitation is working well. However, one full calibration curve consumes ~5% of current MAM01 stock and is required for each analysis.
        *   Currently exploring NISTmAb-based response (adjusted for extinction coefficients) to reduce MAM01 reference standard usage and to streamline AnChem workflow.
    *   Most methods are in place, with the exception of:
        *   SEC; development ongoing
            *   Secondary interactions occurring resulting in the main peak eluting at a retention time of lower molecular weight; currently testing strategies to mitigate these interactions.
        *   CVA main peak similar to reported (by Just), but acidic and basic deviate from reported. We are gathering data by comparing MAM01 standard to samples next week.
        *   **Next step:** Check in re: MAM01 quality methods in first week of Jan
*   **BPD Minipool Downselection (Humira + MAM01) – Confirmation of results from high Qp experiment**
    *   Titer: Completed
    *   Purification Round 1: Completed
        *   Intact glycoforms: Completed
        *   Released glycans: In progress (collecting data)

# BMGF Offline Meeting Notes



# 2025-10-29 BMGF <> Data Collaboration Opportunities

# **BMGF <> Data Collaboration Opportunities**
Wed, 29 Oct 25 · [nessa@prolific-machines.com](mailto:nessa@prolific-machines.com), [matt.fay@prolific-machines.com](mailto:matt.fay@prolific-machines.com), [sasha.howes@prolific-machines.com](mailto:sasha.howes@prolific-machines.com), [declan@prolific-machines.com](mailto:declan@prolific-machines.com)
### **BMGF Data Collaboration Opportunities**
*   Closed-loop control for bioreactor runs
    *   Foundation excited about closed-loop control data
    *   Building out Raman analysis suite to improve titers
    *   Jacqueline (BMGF contact) extremely bullish on closed-loop control with light
        *   She wants to integrate this into broader control mechanisms for distributed/automated manufacturing in Africa
    *   Declan Plans to pitch this to her in December
*   PRADA-style work: predicting optimal light schedules
    *   Could optimize for scale differences (bioreactor vs. deep well plate/TPP)
    *   Feeding strategies differ between scales
    *   Sampling has different impact at different scales
### **Current Experimental Limitations and Plans**
*   Haven’t done PRADA-style optimization in many contexts yet
    *   Not tested in bioreactor with CHO-E using clones
    *   GLIDE project addressing this work
    *   Also applying approach to Green Apple project (more similar to PRADA but CHO-E, clone)
*   Opto team: clones give more precise control than pools
    *   CHO-E shows slower growth - more tradeoff between growth and production
    *   Currently using 24 deep well plates (highest throughput for fed-batch with temp shift, different illumination intensities)
*   Matt hoping Ambr15 can be stood up early next year
    *   Would interrogate temperature, agitation in conjunction with light
    *   Can’t do this currently without extensive manual work
### **Core Model Development and Control Strategies**
*   Matt building core model for optogenetic bioprocess
    *   Takes cell behavior data and translates into useful info for process design, manufacturing control, clone screening
*   Two types of control approaches:
    *   Closed-loop control: following a schedule, handling process variances
    *   Adaptive online control: optimizing bioprocess in real time, changing setpoints based on incoming data (not yet scoped)
*   Goals for BMGF closed-loop control:
    *   Maximize titer
    *   Optimize quality using production rate and feeding strategies
    *   Short-term focus: glucose and lactate control
    *   Near-term easiest implementation would be glucose control (models already exist, Raman capability available) - would need to integrate with pump(s) on DASbox
### **Process Development Considerations and Next Steps**
*   Basanta’s work in 24 deep well plates/TPP informing light conditions
    *   Currently doing pools, then minipools, then clones
    *   Doesn’t currently have light-inducible MAM01 line
    *   Bioprocess perspective: must be minipool or clone work - pools can’t be trusted due to variability
*   Temperature and feeding being optimized for platform process
    *   Works for clone screening but likely won’t work for high-quality product in bioreactor
    *   Sasha: Process parameters like pH, media components may have stronger relationship with transactivator than light
    *   These will impact product quality, especially in bioreactor scale
*   Light optimization timing question: how important before clone selection?
    *   Matt: work will likely look different in clones vs. pools
    *   If Matt provided illumination conditions showing titer increase, Sasha would use that as baseline and tune critical process parameters around it
### **Action Items and Timeline Alignment**
*   [@Matt Fay](#user_mention#75520287) share latest info on potential timing of experiments planned through end of year:
    *   Follow-up experiment (GLIDE) to derisk BMGF work
    *   Modeling Shahram’s PTM control
    *   December/January: helping with Green Apple optimization
*   [@Will Paton](#user_mention#54153245) share likely timing of Basanta's small-scale light schedule studies in UAS clones
*   Align schedules for when clone would be ready for Basanta’s work
    *   Determine scope changes needed for Basanta’s experiments
    *   Assess resource requirements from Matt’s team
*   [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001) and [@Matt Fay](#user_mention#75520287) to discuss Raman data collection structure
    *   Determine what biological samples/replicates would be useful for model development

### **Clone Selection and Performance Issues**
*   Selection of clones 65 and 156 based on transient testing with mScarlet reporter only
*   Clone 65 showed instability: slow growth (40+ hour doubling times), poor viability
*   Clone 156 performance declining over time:
    *   Initial: >1 g/L Herceptin production (3-day illumination)
    *   Later: milligram/L range (7-day illumination)
    *   Current: minimal light induction despite 14-day illumination
*   Root cause likely transactivator silencing/loss due to no selection marker
### **Technical Analysis and Troubleshooting**
*   Construct verification completed: whole plasmid sequencing confirmed correct sequences
*   Fresh DNA prep and new clone 156 thaw both failed to restore performance
*   UAS Humira transient transfection showed weak but detectable light response
*   CMV Mammal1 consistently produces 2-6 g/L in same host background
*   Host cell line (clone 156) appears compromised for optogenetic system
### **Current Mitigation Strategies**
*   Engineering constructs with introns (CMV intron and EF1α intron) for both CMV and UAS versions
*   Testing in GAVPO pool (different from 2-3 clone pool - 021\_004\_P\_1281\_bulk\_H)
*   Pool-based approach now considered safer than individual clones
*   Double selection strategy (Puro + GS) being evaluated
### **Alternative Development Paths**
*   Cry2olig system as backup: Max has mixed clone pools available
    *   Performance: ~3 g/L but only 10% cells respond vs 70-80% for GAVPO
    *   Concerns about long-term stability and copy number effects
*   Shahram’s suggestion: transfect top 8 CLD hosts and screen for best performers
*   All-in-one approach with separate selection markers for transactivator
### **CMV Comparator Strategy Challenges**
*   Gates Foundation requires CMV control in same host background
*   Current strategy makes apples-to-apples comparison difficult due to:
    *   No control over transactivator copy numbers
    *   Different selection pressures between CMV and UAS lines
*   Options under consideration:
    *   Use clean parental background without opto system
    *   Use GAVPO pool as common background
    *   Generate CMV lines in parallel with new constructs
### **Action Items and Timeline**
*   **Nessa**: Review Gates Foundation agreement language, draft CMV cell line strategy proposal (which host, plus whether to continue process dev in clone 156 to try to reach >10 g/L)
*   **Max & Nessa**: Compare notes on intron designs, connect on best Cry2olig host selection
*   Pool testing results expected by December 1st
*   Potential handoff to BPD by early January if pools successful
*   Grant experimental work deadline: end of March 2026
*   Freeze/thaw stability testing needed for all selected hosts before engineering

# 2025-12-04 MAM01 Cloning Discussion

# Will's Notes:
*   Prolific standard vector - good backup strategy
*   John is not familiar with Opto’s cloning strategy - would need training or help from someone on Opto
    *   3 chains strategy was relatively inefficient
*   Makoto just finished up with cloning for Raspberry
*   Makoto: plasmid design is not likely what is causing the issues (intron is intact)
    *   We started seeing issues before introns
*   Which vector has been used successfully - would be worth transferring MAM01 into?
    *   2-3 clone uses weak GS cassette - we don’t want to use this
    *   Right  now we don’t have another one that is validated to produce high amounts of protein
    *   Seesha had one that was producing 1 g/L at pool stage
    *   Now testing many GS cassettes. Won’t have data for several weeks
    *   For raspberry - they are using one of the new designs (shot in dark) and weak GS cassette
    *   Using original weaker GS cassette because not sure if cells using new GS cassette will recover
    *   Only difference in new backbone - restriction sites
        *   New sequence has Insulators flanking ITRs - this is why cloning is hard in new vectors
        *   Original sequence has PolyAs
*   Goal - 
    *   Have an opto cell line that is actually producing
    *   Original CMV design for MAM01 - producing 6+ g/L at pool stage
        *   No intron
        *   We haven’t tested copy number
        *   Only took 2 weeks to recover for pool
        *   Seems like long recovery (5-6 weeks) was because of unoptimized CLD process, not because of high copy number
*   Max:
    *   One approach - use more stringent GS cassette. Likely to get higher copy number
    *   Just do more electroporations
    *   This has weak cassette in vector backbone
*   Promoter
    *   Used 5x MLV for first version of MAM01.
        *   Worked for humira in expicho and chozn. not in CHOZN Elite. And not for MAM01. 
    *   We are getting very weak expression for light-inducible proteins
    *   8xUAS minCMV only with two diff introns 
        *   Have not tested without intron
*   Transient transfection - see more dark expression
*   The fact that we did see something for transient expression is encouraging (from Makoto)
*   Recent test - lower expression for UAS
    *   GAVPO pool from Seesha
    *   Makes sense that this is lower. Pool is not complete
    *   Only saw 20% increase for GAVPO compared to CMV in stable pool. Then when clonal, saw 2x increase
    *   Need to go clonal to see effect
*   Could run a similar transient transfection experiment to what Nessa presented, using our Humira and MAM01 constructs and their UAS-Humira construct (use the construct from Clone pool #3)
    *   Humira LLH - old backbone (no insulators) and new backbone (with insulators)
        *   Has IRES-mScarlet 
    *   Their vectors are likely much larger. If they still get higher titers with their vector, then there is likely a problem with our vector
    *   Add a TetR clone to this experiment?
*   Makoto looked at intron, it seemed fine

# **Granola Notes: MAM01 cloning discussion**
Thu, 04 Dec 25 · JellyBelly-1-Juicy Pear (12), [nessa@prolific-machines.com](mailto:nessa@prolific-machines.com), [max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com](mailto:max.hoerner@prolific-machines.com), [makoto.lalwani@prolific-machines.com](mailto:makoto.lalwani@prolific-machines.com)
### **TL;DR:**
*   MAM01 produces well with CMV promoter (6-7 g/L) but fails with light-inducible UAS promoters despite successful Humira production using same system
*   Current blocker: John lacks familiarity with Opto team’s cloning methods, and Makoto unavailable after completing Raspberry project cloning
*   Transient transfection data shows promising results with 8x UAS minCMV + introns, suggesting stable cell lines may work
*   Next step: comparative transient experiment using Humira constructs from both teams to determine if vector backbone differences explain performance gaps
*   Backup strategy remains moving MAM01 into Prolific’s standard vector backbone for risk mitigation
### **Background:**
*   Meeting focused on MAM01 cloning strategy discussion between teams
*   Goal: establish backup cloning strategy using Prolific’s standard vector backbone to compare against current opto team approach
*   Current challenge: MAM01 produces excellently under CMV control but shows poor light-inducible expression, contrasting with successful Humira light-inducible production
### **Meeting Notes:**
### **Current MAM01 Production Status**
*   CMV version producing 6-7 grams per liter at pool stage without introns
*   Light-inducible versions showing very weak expression despite multiple attempts
*   Pool recovery taking only 2 weeks (vs previous 5-6 week recoveries due to unoptimized cell line development process)
*   Copy number testing not yet completed but appears relatively low based on fast recovery
### **Vector Design Challenges**
*   Prolific standard vector strategy blocked by John’s unfamiliarity with Opto cloning methods
*   Makoto just completed Raspberry project cloning and unavailable for additional work
*   Three-chain cloning strategy relatively inefficient for making heavy-light constructs
*   Current vector backbone differences:
    *   Original design: no insulators, has polyA sequences flanking IPRs
    *   New backbone: CHS4 insulators flanking IPRs causing cloning efficiency issues
    *   New backbone also includes woodchuck element and IRES insulator between MAC cassettes and GS cassette
### **GS Cassette Testing Status**
*   Clone 2-3 uses very weak GS cassette (not recommended for this project)
*   No currently validated high-producing alternative available
*   Multiple GS cassettes with different promoter strengths under testing, but data won’t be available for several weeks
*   For Raspberry project: using both new design (untested) and weak GS cassette as backup due to recovery uncertainty
### **Promoter Performance Analysis**
*   5x UAS MLV: worked for Humira in ExpiCHO and CHOZN but failed in CHOZN Elite and for MAM01
*   8x UAS minCMV with introns: showed encouraging transient transfection results
*   Previous data showed UAS constructs outperforming CMV in stable cell lines, but current results show opposite trend
*   EF1α intron showing higher expression than CMV intron in transients but may cause dark activation
### **Transient Transfection Results**
*   8x UAS minCMV with CMV intron: similar performance to CMV control
*   8x UAS minCMV with EF1α intron: higher expression but potential dark activation concerns
*   Seeing measurable shifts in transient assays is encouraging (broken constructs show no shift)
*   Pool-level data expected tonight with clonal selection planned for tomorrow
### **Technical Sequence Analysis**
*   Makoto reviewed intron sequences: virtually identical except for 3’ splice site differences
*   Issue predates intron insertion, suggesting plasmid design not the primary cause
*   Signal peptide differences between MAM01 and Humira being investigated as potential factor
### **Decisions, Action Items & Next Steps:**
*   Run comparative transient transfection experiment:
    *   Use Humira constructs from both teams (LLH vs HLL format acceptable)
    *   Include old backbone (no insulators) and new backbone (with insulators) versions
    *   Compare against current MAM01 constructs
    *   Nessa and Makoto to collaborate on construct selection
*   Consider adding TetR clone system to comparison experiment
*   Schedule follow-up meeting to review transient experiment data
*   Decision on proceeding with vector backbone cloning depends on comparative results:
    *   If similar expression observed, current vector likely not the issue
    *   If significant performance difference, proceed with backbone transfer strategy
*   Monitor stable cell line production data coming in tonight
*   Amritha testing cry2-olig system with CMV intron design in TEP clones (results pending)
* * *

# 2025-12-18 Talking through CMV-MAM01 scale up options

Attendees - [@Kiana Mohajeri](#user_mention#75301689) [@Sasha Howes](#user_mention#75501001)

Kiana's thoughts
*   John R's currently completed clone screen production run is on CMV-MAM01 clones generated in the 156 GAVPO clone background
    *   24DWP production run with multiple timepoints - data in benchling by Friday, can highlight top performers on titer, viability, and VCD, need to confirm when we'll have AnChem data
    *   Need to confirm - do we have info on growth stability?
    *   These clones provide us with an example set that expresses CMV-MAM01 but is distinct on multiple technical fronts from future CMV clones we'll likely want to prioritize for a best match to our opto lines that are actively being generated. Ways they differ:
        *   Background - just WT CHOE in the future -- is this true? Is this in GAVPO pool or WT CHOE?
        *   Expression cassette (aka vector/plasmid)
            *   P\_2117 used in current clone set in 156 background
            *   P\_2117 in addition to P\_2701 and P\_2702, cassettes with different introns (likely higher expr) are included in the new clone set that more recently came off the beacon and were transfected into WT background
            *   There's also a newer set of CMV/opto vectors being generated in the new year in the Prolific vector
            *   Also will have "super all in one" tfx happening in new year, also in WT CHOE background
*   For the next wave of CMV-MAM01 clones - currently in growth stage post-beacon export, will be maintained in culture over the holiday break
    *   Clone screen production run data and banking likely complete somewhere between mid-late Jan
    *   Earliest handoff point likely in that time frame
*   Want to balance fact that we're at the point where all data is good data with what can we learn from a line that is expressing our molecule of interest but in a context that is distinct from what will likely be a "final" set of opto and CMV lines

In meeting notes/action items
*   Sasha agrees maybe waiting until we have a CMV clone that's more representative of the final set will be better
*   Lots of unknowns with current clones, we'll have to make best judgement guesses on some factors given that data is actively being generated
*   Sasha note - higher VCD and slower viability decline, that's a preferred clone
*   If there's a big Qp swing, not ideal clone

Agreed upon next steps:
*   Sasha to continue with TPP on top 156-CMV-MAM01 clones as planned, this is a gating point, let's compare this TPP data which will likely be in hand around the same time as the new set of CMV clones going into a 24DWP run in the new year. Can make a decision on what to move forward with in bioreactors at that point
*   Topic came up on CMV lines - how much do we want to try and adhere to an apples-to-apples comparison vs trying to make the best CMV line possible
*   Sasha - let's align on clone screen process so matches same process, media %s used as what Sasha has planned for downstream to make sure there is max comparability
    *   Same for GA!
*   Kiana - there may be tradeoffs in process we use for max comparability with past clone screen production runs vs Sasha's updated media and feed process used for scale up. Let's discuss these options at the point of production runs to make sure we're prioritizing the right things in each case
