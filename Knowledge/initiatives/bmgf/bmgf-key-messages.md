# BMGF Project Key Messages (Kiana 12/19/2025)

## Context
Kiana’s 12/19/2025 note to the team after 1:1s, intended as a re-orienting tool for the new year.

## Key Messages (Summary)
- Keep parallel workstreams to preserve optionality; use data to down-select quickly.
- Use pool production runs to inform Beacon load decisions (target 3–5 pools).
- Align upstream screening conditions with downstream BPD process work.
- Generate data on available MAM01 lines now; do not wait for “ideal” clones.
- Maintain transparency about tradeoffs when selecting clones for scale-up.
- Keep Aims 2/3 moving via BLIMP1/PYC2 in CMV-Humira, then port to CMV-MAM01.

## Original Message (verbatim)
Hi all, thanks so much to everyone who made time to connect with me this week on ongoing and planned BMGF work. I am getting an increasingly good sense of the work streams the team has been driving and with the understanding I have now, I think on the whole the current strategies are solid paths forward. Sharing a few high level notes based on the 1:1 convos I've had, bulleted by work stream. I know it's long (sorry!) - wanted to share my current understanding of things before the holiday and have this as a re-orienting tool in the new year.
There are many work streams currently going in parallel - let's continue to try lots of things, give ourselves options, and generate data quickly to inform stringent down-selections. We can't and won't carry it all but the optionality at the top of the funnel will be helpful to us.
Please comment in the thread with clarifying questions, if you think I've left something out, or have more detail you'd like to add to a work stream:
Optochassis CLD, pool generation into current top few GAVPO and Cry2 clones*, also testing double selection - Amritha will be carrying these pools in culture through the holidays and will test their relative production performance once they're ready (likely sometime in late Dec/early Jan) - thank you, Amritha!! Based on how these look, we'll make decisions on which pools we want to load onto the Beacon in January for another round of clones to screen. We'll use the pool production run to cut down on number of pools that are loaded on to the beacon (I think targeting somewhere between 3-5 pools for loading likely makes sense but let's see how the data looks). This tentative Beacon run is set for somewhere between 1/9-1/23 depending on when pools are ready, will need to coordinate with Raspberry given they're also interested in a run.
Important note - my suggestion is to have the process used for this pool production run match as closely as possible to the prior recent MAM01 pool production runs (or batch runs) prior to Beacon load. I see this as being helpful in guiding our decision making as to whether to prioritize these or other pools for Beacon load. On the off chance these pools for whatever reason are underperforming relative to others, would be good to know and might change our decision making to load. I know there's also interest in aligning upstream screening media composition/feeds with downstream processes Sasha has been optimizing - my suggestion is let's be sure to integrate that at the clone screen stage so we have that info going into a BPD handoff.
*denotes this is based on our current best understanding but characterization is ongoing external to BMGF project
156 CMV clones, CMV-MAM01 expressing lines in 156 GAVPO clone background - these lines were Beacon sorted and clone screen production run will be complete on Monday. John and I will analyze the BLI titer, other run performance metrics, and John is submitting Day 10 material to AnChem for SEC and intact mass, as well as hold on to Day 7 material in case we need it. This will be info that we'll compile and shared with Sasha so we can down-select a handful of clones to go into a TPP run in the new year to further down-select what makes it into a dasbox. Sasha and I are in agreement to go ahead with the TPP run on these clones in the new year but that the CMV clones from the all-in-one set (next main bullet below) will be important to compare side-by-side to decide whether these or those CMV clones should get scaled up further.
Important note - I think it makes a lot of sense at this stage to generate the data we can on the MAM01 lines we have (not just wait for clones we want but are in the process of being generated). I've raised to Sasha and Alex some of the technical differences between these 156 background CMV clones and composition we anticipate our more "final" clone will have (vector, opto system, etc) - I think is just a matter of us discussing pros/cons and making decisions with shared understanding. Let's plan to have this series of decision making convos for dasbox scale up in the new year as we have data from the 156 24DWP, 156 TPP, and all-in-one 24DWP runs in hand.
All-in-one CLD, pool generation into enriched GAVPO pool - these CMV and Opto clones are in culture and growing post-Beacon sort. These represent a few cassette backgrounds for both CMV and Opto. They will be maintained in culture over the holiday break (thank you, Nora!), goal being to have them grow up and generate sufficient material for banking and continued scale up for a clone screen production run once we're back in the new year. John and Basanta, I think it will be great to plan for a set of production runs screening these clones first thing in January - will be important to align with Sasha to see how we can best align media/feed process in this screen experiment with downstream experiments.
Super all-in-one CLD, pool generation with MAM01 expression cassette and selectable GAVPO plasmid with blasticidin selection. Basanta is planning to start this tfx in the new year given timing of plasmid availability.
Important note - Nora is quickly cloning a version of the MAM01 plasmid in the prolific backbone, which should be ready before the end of the year. My suggestion is let's plan to include both that new prolific vector MAM01 plasmid alongside the top BMGF/Nessa MAM01 plasmid (would be great to touch base before the tfx to make sure we're prioritizing the right plasmids, Basanta).
Prolific vector CLD, cloning MAM01 into most recent version of prolific vector, testing latest vector component hypotheses to increase titer, with FTO. The goal here is to get MAM01 into the same vector context a the other customer projects and have a fully FTO option, should we need it. John H is leading this effort for the high mAb titer project and will bring MAM01 along for the ride, working closely alongside Nora. Once we have the plasmids (can share the variations we'll test in the new year if anyone is curious), we'll generate those pools, informed by learnings from optochassis and all-in-one approaches above, and consider them for Beacon loading. We'll make both Opto and CMV (in WT) pools with these vectors. These will be staggered further behind so I see these as a potentially important set to carry forward but suggest we don't want to wait for these for BPD scale up since that would create a timeline crunch.
BMGF Aims 2 and 3, testing Blimp and PYC2 in CMV-humira and CMV-MAM01 contexts. The work to demonstrate light-inducible Blimp/accessory OE improving titers is underway in the CMV-humira context within STRIDE (also an explicit aim for the Raspberry project). We'll plan to have the STRIDE crew do cell line generation including Blimp and PYC2 in a solidly performing CMV-MAM01 clone (with GAVPO or Cry2, likely GAVPO given leak concerns of the latter) and test those alongside the humira lines. Am planning to talk with Nessa to better understand how to prioritize these aims and what we think the foundation is most interested to see.
We'll discuss this and other related topics in the next BMGF stand-up in the new year (1/6). Will add folks who are involved in various work streams both to this channel and that meeting so we can use it both for within-project alignment and making sure project-adjacent stakeholders are informed.
Hope everyone has a nice holiday season and am looking forward to picking back up in January! (edited)

For posterity adding here that Basanta informed me there is another set of CMV-MAM01 lines in the 156 background he's been working with (GS/Puro/MSX-CMV, triple selection). These will have 24DWP production run data on the top 24 clones on the same timeline as the 156 CMV clones mentioned above. Can factor these in for next steps as well - will be important to consider all CMV lines together to decide which we want to carry forward and why

Sasha (12/19/2025, 4:14 PM)
@Kiana Please share the vector component hypotheses and plasmid designs when you have them!

Shahram (12/22/2025, 1:45 PM)
There is also one arm going on with Mamo-1 transfection into the GAVPO pool with double selection that Basanta is doing. I am not sure if it was captured in your list. It is the equivalent of CMV-Mamo1 in the 156, except using GAVPO pools

Kiana (12/22/2025, 2:34 PM)
Thank you for adding that, @Shahram - are those at the same stage of data generation as the 156 double selection, @Basanta? 24DWP run currently ongoing or to start soon?

Basanta (12/22/2025, 2:40 PM)
This experiment is in a very early stage. The pools are still in selection right now. The production run will ideally start in a couple of weeks.
2:43
The experiment's goal is to optimize the transfection and selection process. I will make a spreadsheet with all the ongoing experiments with their relevant objectives/teams, Benchling entries and share it with you soon.
