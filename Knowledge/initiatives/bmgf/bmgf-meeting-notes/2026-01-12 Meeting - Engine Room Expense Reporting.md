## Budget Status Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Remaining balance (after Nov 2025) | $972,000 |
| Monthly spend rate (2025 avg) | ~$142,000 |
| Direct costs + benefits spend | 17-18% (vs 31% budgeted) |
| Indirect cost rate | 15% |

### Critical Issue: $57K Double-Count
- Nessa double-counted $57,000 in Period 1 reporting
- Indirect costs (15%) were already included in monthly invoices
- **Action:** Adjust this amount in next reporting cycle

---

## Expense Reporting Process

### How expenses are tracked
- Monthly report from Happy Labs filtered by project code
- Expenses must be earmarked from the beginning for proper categorization
- Credit card charges tracked separately each month

### Timesheet Requirements
- John Resngit (formerly Hydrogen contract, now FTE) requires timesheets
- **January complexity:** Now tracking two separate projects (BMGF + Radiant)
- Daily individual entries required (not percentage-based rollups)
- PTO and holiday hours must be separated for audit purposes
- Engine Room's template has passed multiple grant audits
- **Submit timesheets directly to:** Julienne Riveong + Diana Pham (not general accounting)

### Re-categorizing Purchases (Standing POs)
To reallocate expenses, provide:
- Invoice amount
- Invoice number
- Date
- Project number
- Department

Engine Room can create journal entries for proper allocation.
