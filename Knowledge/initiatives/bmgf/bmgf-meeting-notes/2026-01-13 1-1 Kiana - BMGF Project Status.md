### Project Status & Prioritization

- **Updated ClickUp timeline** based on estimates for clone recovery timing
  - Week 4: 96-well plate screen
  - Week 5-6: 24-well plate screen
  - Timeline may need adjustment pending pool analysis today
- **Current plasmid prep/sequencing practices** - standardizing on Genewiz for final plasmid confirmation
  - Don't use sequences generated at time of plasmid prep
- **Basanta's recent pool data showing concerning leak levels**
  - Much worse than expected even with poor insulators
  - May need to elevate priority of Prolific vector development
  - Could impact what goes onto the Beacon
  - Need Max's technical input on cassette viability
- **Super all-in-one transfections** planned this week by Basanta
  - Quick Prolific vector should be ready (Nora overcame cloning challenges)
  - If plasmids not ready by tomorrow, proceed with non-Prolific version
  - "Official" MA01 integration happening via High MAB project

### Tomorrow's Team Meeting Agenda

- **Pool analysis discussion** - address leak concerns with smaller technical group first
- **CLD process presentation** by Ian covering:
  - Single source of truth for each stage from pool generation to final clone
  - Decision criteria for down-selection
  - Anchem characterizations at each stage
- **Project goals alignment** - establish clear "North Star" for team
- **Best practices** for plasmid prep and sequencing protocols

### Budget Management & Administrative

- **Current BMGF spend status** (as of end November):
  - Spent: $2,207,369 of $3,179,736 total
  - Remaining: $972,368
  - At current rate (~$142k/month), ~$400k will remain unspent
- **Personnel vs. direct costs imbalance**
  - Significant underspend on personnel side
  - Options: adjust FTE calculations, ramp up time allocation, year-end corrections
- **Engine Room deadline** January 19th for budget adjustments for december
- **Benchling export capability** confirmed - can download .gb files with annotations for Geneious upload

### Action Items

- Will: Schedule smaller group discussion today on pool leak concerns (Shahram, Max, Basanta)
- Kiana: Follow up with Ian on CLD process presentation readiness for tomorrow
- Will: Contact Victor, Christina, Kurt regarding budget reallocation strategy
- Will: Draft budget question for Nessa regarding disputed $57k manual recalculation
- Kiana: Ask Max about cassette configuration insights during upcoming meeting
