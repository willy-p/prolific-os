# WuXi Project Reference

## Overview
Partnership/contract work with WuXi for cell line development (CLD).

## Key Decisions & Context

### Analytical Strategy (from 2026-01-08 AnChem meeting)
- **Contract scope:** Titer measurement + PQ characteristics relevant to each molecule
- **Quality philosophy:** Ensure correct proteoform distribution on every project
- **Progressive QC:** Increase quality metrics as we progress through CLD process

### Method Development Estimates
| Method | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Affinity method dev | 1 FTE × 1 week (typical), 2-4 weeks (worst case) |

### Bispecifics Approach
- Characterization of heterogeneity requires specialized tools (capex dependent)
- Preferred approach: Method transfer from epcoritamab if applicable
