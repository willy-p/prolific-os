## Analytical for DTPT

### Identity Confirmation
- Confirm identity, especially for non-mAb molecules
- True expression is ultimately what they care about

### SEC (Size Exclusion Chromatography)
- May be useful for aggregation if molecules are very prone to it
- If not prone to aggregation, not very useful
- Could be phrased as "a quality attribute" to confirm identity at pool stage
- Team gravitated towards SEC due to lots of fragmentation with early 2025 mAbs

### BLI (Biolayer Interferometry)
- Could make sense for Fc-containing or tagged molecules
- Extending ProA method is not a lot of extra work if molecule has Fc
- Uses surrogate, correction factor
- Not a lot of experimentation time to validate that correction factor

### Purification Considerations
- Fair amount of work for relatively low ROI to do another characterization post-purification
- A280 is done at end of purification
- Orthogonal assays provide additional information
- Mass spec is made easier after purification
- For crude material, depends on expression level

### What's Done Depends on the Molecule
- For contract: doing titer measurement and PQ characteristic that is relevant for the molecules (align on at later stage)
- For **EVERY** project: ensure correct proteoform distribution

### Ian's Opinion
- At pool stage: do every characterization that is relevant
- Need certainty that you are producing the right DS that is relevant for product
- Increase number of quality metrics as we progress through the CLD process
- More method development in preparation for phase 2 if it's relevant
- Have conversation at time of project scoping

### Affinity Method Development
- 1 FTE for 1 week (high estimate)
- Worst case: 2-4 weeks of dev time

### Bispecifics
- Need tool to do characterization of heterogeneity
- Can be done if we have capex
- May take more complex methods if we don't have the right tools
- More expensive assays to develop characterization around
- Ideally method transfer from epcoritamab

## Action Items
- [ ] Align on PQ characteristics relevant for molecules at later stage
- [ ] Have conversation about quality metrics at time of project scoping
- [ ] Consider capex for bispecific characterization tools
- [ ] Explore method transfer from epcoritamab for bispecifics
