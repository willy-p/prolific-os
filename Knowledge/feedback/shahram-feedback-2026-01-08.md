# Feedback for Shahram – January 2026

## Context

Shahram is tech lead on the subcon project; I'm PM. We generally work well together – he's friendly and supportive – but he can be chaotic: not tracking conversations in meetings, going off in different directions, not aligning with the group before making changes.

**Triggering situation:** In yesterday's team meeting, we spent time working through beacon scheduling. Shahram wasn't engaged (on his computer), then 20 minutes later raised a request to demonstrate an accelerated CLD timeline – which would upend the plans we'd just discussed. The change? About two weeks. He then talked with Victor and Vidar without me (after I'd asked to be included), and started changing plans with Noreen before we'd aligned as a group. No notes were taken.

## Slack Message to Request the 1:1

> Hey Shahram – do you have 15 min to chat today or tomorrow? I wanted to debrief on the subcon project and share some thoughts on how we're working together. Let me know what works.

## Feedback Script

### Opening – set the tone

"Hey, I wanted to chat because I think we work well together overall, and I want to make sure we stay aligned as things get busier on subcon. I have a couple of things I wanted to share."

---

### Feedback #1 – Not being included in the scope conversation

"When you talked with Victor and Vidar yesterday about the patent claim and accelerated CLD – I'd asked to be included in that conversation, and I wasn't. That put me in a tough spot, because decisions were being made about our project scope without me there.

As the PM on this, I need to be in the room when we're discussing changes to what we're delivering or when. Not because I need to control it – but because I need to understand the reasoning so I can help us figure out what's feasible and keep the plan accurate.

Going forward, can we agree that if there's a conversation about scope or timeline, you'll loop me in – or at least give me a heads up before we start changing plans?"

---

### Feedback #2 – No documentation

"The other thing – there weren't any notes from that conversation, so I don't have visibility into what was actually decided or why. That makes it hard for me to do my job.

When we make decisions, especially with leadership, I'd like us to document them – even just a quick Slack message summarizing what we agreed. Can we do that going forward?"

---

### Feedback #3 – Meeting derail (optional, smaller)

"One more thing, and this is smaller – in yesterday's team meeting, we spent a chunk of time working through the beacon scheduling, and then later you brought up the accelerated timeline request, which kind of reset the conversation.

The change we're talking about is pulling the timeline forward by about two weeks. That might be worth doing – but the way it came up derailed a conversation we'd just finished, and led to plan changes before we'd aligned as a group. I want us to be more deliberate about how we raise scope changes, especially when the impact is relatively small.

I know meetings can be a lot, but it helps when we're all tracking the same thread."

---

### Close

"I'm sharing this because I want us to work well together, and I think we can. I just want to make sure I'm set up to do my job as PM. Does this make sense? Anything on your end?"

---

## If He Gets Defensive

Listen, but hold the line:

"I hear you, and I still need to be in those conversations going forward."

---

## Key Principles (for future reference)

- Lead with the relationship ("we work well together")
- Use "I" statements – focus on impact to you, not his character
- Be specific and actionable – not "you don't pay attention" but "loop me in on scope conversations"
- Give him a clear ask he can say yes to
- Feedback lands better when it's about specific behavior + impact, not patterns or personality
